        "Review": "\u010cevap is focused on the barbecue classics, the one that takes us back to the time when barbecue was a weekly family ritual. The favorite in the menu is, of course, the juicy \u0107evapi served with chopped onions and kajmak that melts in the hot flatbread. There are also pljeskavice, spicy sausages, and shish kebab, while true gourmets choose tripes or veal kidneys. Top\u2013quality meat is perfectly accompanied with a large selection of fresh salads, and French fries and hot buns complete the pleasure. Wash down each bite with wine from the famous local winery, it can also be ordered by the glass.",

        "Review": "Restaurant Trofej is located in the ethnic village of Tiganjica on the road to Zrenjanin, and near tourist attractions such as the village of Belo Blato and Carska Bara. And the ethnic village itself with a small zoo and plenty of farming content will attract the attention of children if you visit the restaurant with your family. What will certainly attract the attention of adults, especially adult gourmets, is the content of the menu in the restaurant itself. Trofej is thematically related to hunting specialties that make up a popular segment of the menu. Starting with \u2013 starters, but wild, with a mixture of prosciutto from deer, wild boar, and European fallow deer, to equally wild and yet homemade sausages from European fallow deer and Mangalica, there is wild boar stew as well as a great venison stew with mlinci, baked in wood fired stove. The perfect rolled veal under the sa\u010d comes out of from under the fire and embers, there is also the Trofej wild burger, and for the bravest, there is also a couple of versions of grilled series, called voz (train). Since the big fishery E\u010dka is close by, a good supply of fresh river fish is expected \u2013 carp, perch, and trout. With the sounds of tamburica, sipping good homemade rakija in a warm homely atmosphere, we are certain you will enjoy this interesting restaurant.",

        "Review": "The famous corner of Vra\u010dar remembers many iconic catering names of the Belgrade scene and several creative culinary approaches. The interior subtly blends different styles, from classic to modern, making you feel cozy and comfortable just like in a Parisian bistro. The menu is brief and carefully designed to take you on an exciting journey that boldly mixes gastro styles and influences. Start with onion soup. With a bit of cognac and a fine balance of intense aromas of cheese and onion, it is the right way to open the door to the local gastronomic world. Tartare or carpaccio can be the next step, and from the hot appetizers section we recommend the attractive tonkatsu - a great wok fillet prepared with spinach and mushrooms. On a similar note in the main menu, the Japanese calamari with nishiki rice and seasonal vegetables from the wok was excellent. The classic lasagna was excellent, and the chicken tikka took us to another part of Asia, with an equally effective balance of flavors. The selection of steaks and Adriatic fish is a special part of the offer. Recommended dishes are the Irish ale pie, and the Cafe de Paris slice. The staff is discreet and confident in every recommendation. In the sweet section, they are proud of the floating island according to a recipe from 1953, while the warm date cake deserves more than a warm recommendation. A restaurant that will seduce you with its special charm both in the atmosphere and ambience, both on your plate and in your glass.",

You passthe ovens ay the entrance, and you can immediately smell cooked lamb, veal and top-quality pork. One of the experiences that you willremember is the delicious freshly baked bread with a crunchy crust. Since everything has to make sense in farm life, it is logical that everything possible is produced right there, on the farm. From roasted peppers - for salads, ajvar and pin\u0111ur, sauerkraut and pickles, to the pig slaughter feast where masters process the meat into all the products we love so much. A small, hardworking community on this farm is creating its gastronomic story bravely and with a lot of effort. They get better over time, and we are looking forward to witnessing their interesting progress in the years to come.",

        "Review": "The Zvonko Bogdan Winery Sala\u0161 in Belgrade, located at the very beginning of Beton hala, was designed after the original farmhouse located in the north of Serbia near the Pali\u0107 Lake. The idea was to bring to the capital the special feelings of enjoying good home\u2013 cooked food, wine and an atmosphere filled with the pleasant sounds of tamburica. We can gladly say that they have succeeded. Sala\u0161 pays due attention to the food, both by nurturing their verified long\u2013term suppliers and in preparing the ingredients that are combined into some of the most famous Vojvodina specialties. Most of the well\u2013 known specialties from the original Sala\u0161 are in the menu, and some new ones were specially prepared for Belgrade guests. Vojvodina\u2019s hot gibanica is one of the best cheese pies we\u2019ve ever enjoyed. You will also enjoy the perfectly executed deep\u2013fried peppers stuffed with cheese and gourmet delights such as marinated smoked veal tongue on a tortilla base, and celery salad with eggs. Don\u2019t miss the carrot soup with semolina dumplings! Moving on to the main dishes, we suggest the duck under the sa\u010d served on mlinci, or some of the gourmet dishes such as lamb shanks, or spicy pork hooves. Don\u2019t forget that you are at Sala\u0161, a place to relax, the evenings are a real pleasure with the sounds of tamburica from Vojvodina and selected live music.",

The main star of the menu is the pork bayadere, juicy and soft boned meat with a perfectly crispy and salty skin. Trays with roast meat arrive quickly on the table, and with the meat we recommend salads made of fresh or sauerkraut sprinkled with spicy paprika, and roasted chili peppers with garlic, as well as a basket with bread and cornbread, complete a real feast. If there is space left, indulge in the few, but well-selected, desserts. The restaurant is near the lake, so you will definitely enjoy a walk after your meal.",

This is followed by a carefully designed wine list and an exciting list of drinks with an accent on Japanese origins. Greetings from the kitchen in the form of a subtle salmon mousse in vinegar and soy sauce herald the sensations. Appetizers are classics of Japanese cuisine, from great gyoza with duck, and tuna tartare, to attractively served spring rolls with prawns. In the tempura section, the soft-shell crab is very special, a refreshing option with seasonal vegetables, followed by sushi in several amazing selections or in the classic form \u2013 nigiri, maki, sashimi. For starters there are spicy tom yum, and classic miso soup, udon noodles are excellent in several variations. The aburi selection is unusual, while the teppanyaki segment has aged steak, salmon, and tuna tataki. The selection of desserts is European and captivates with subtle sweet notes. Lucious cardamon with banana jam, vanilla cream, cardamom, and orange, and Grand pleasure with nougat, milk chocolate and hazelnut ice cream.

An impressive wine list with almost three hundred labels from all the meridians confirms hedonistic orientation. When you add perfect service, staff that discreetly combines experience and youth, all you need to do is to let go. The coconut\u2013prawn soup is an absolute recommendation, and the subtle salad of baby spinach, peaches, beets, and crushed hazelnuts with young goat cheese mousse is one of the favorites on the menu. Tender prawn tartare with avocado and eel sauce continues this streak, and there are also veal fillet tartare and beef cheeks with parsnip puree and white chocolate. The part with pastas and risotto is short and intriguing, such as lavish ravioli with duck and foie gras, and creamy risotto with sea bass. In the meat section, the Toro ribs were excellent as one of the novelties on offer, and on the main stage, look into seafood delicacies, as well as the steaks from Golija beef, and the Mangalica cutlet. The sweet part is an equally stunning addition. Suggestive chocolate Nemesis, gentle semifreddo, New York style cheesecake, and striking lemon tart make the choice sweet and painful.

Explore further with tuna tartare with avocado, or grilled goose liver in red wine sauce. This sauce gives the note of perfection to the soft and juicy veal fillet with homemade gnocchi and vegetables.

The extravagant combination of the taste of beef, mushrooms, prosciutto, mustard, and crispy puff pastry will definitely not leave you indifferent. If you thought that the culinary magic ends there, wait for the conclusions, because the best may be yet to come in the desserts.

        "Review": "If you want to feel a touch of authentic Italy in the heart of Belgrade, the Gallo Nero restaurant is the right choice for you. It is located in the center of the city, with a hidden patio and elegant interior with carefully selected furniture and decorations. Be completely spoiled by the gastronomic offer of food and drinks in this restaurant. Start your adventure with light starters, such as aromatized prawns with Taggiasca olives and capers on polenta, or Coquille St Jacques with parmesan and artichokes. One of the creatively designed salads or traditional Italian soups can be your next step of pleasure. For full enjoyment, there are the best pieces of meat and fish such as Angus steak in Barolo red wine sauce with mashed potato and caramelized red onion, veal steak medallions in black truffle sauce with homemade gnocchi, or salmon and asparagus on lemon cream. The premium selection of dishes is accompanied by meticulously selected wines from the Apennine peninsula and a top selection of domestic and foreign spirits. Don\u2019t forget to leave room for dessert and a good espresso, because the pleasure is not complete before you taste the rhapsody of flavors of the pistachio-raspberry cake or the chocolate decadence. For a moment, you will wonder who needs a trip to Italy when its selected flavors can be tasted right at Gallo Nero.",

When you come in and look at the carefully designed menu, a minimalist style with hints of the Orient hits you, you see a different concept. Dive into the depths of new flavors by opening with fish bone soup with prawn meat and the addition of burnt leek oil, or tom yum soup, prepared in a homemade way. Then, as the most beautiful notes, there are delicacies such as soft carp roe rolled in kunafa dough with vermouth sauce, beef tongue rose with mole sauce, pistachios and pickled onions and a combination of quick-smoked prawns with onion ice cream, cherry and champagne sorbet and crunchy crackers from cuttlefish ink. Main courses such as catfish with sous vide leeks, celery chutney, lemon zest jam and pepper sauce bring the pinnacle of artistic expression. Or, juicy quail combined with goose liver seasoned with java pepper, apple and carrot puree with crispy wheat. If you find it difficult to choose among the sea of sensations, tasting menus with 5, 7 or 10 courses will help. Round off the experience with an interesting dessert such as banana cardamom cake or crunchy caramel.",

With an impressive list of 600 different labels and a curated selection of wines by the glass, pairing food and drink in this small wine universe is easy to indulge in. The friendly staff are available to help you choose labels that perfectly match your wishes and mood. In addition to the wine offer, the bar also offers a large selection of spirits, cigars, chocolates and gifts for wine lovers, as well as a carefully prepared menu inspired by the flavors of Italy, France and Serbia.",

Guests can choose between crispy, thin dough, and soft, thick dough. Over twenty pizzas with creative combinations are offered, and we recommend Bianca with carbonara sauce, Siena with artichokes, a sumptuous Truffle Burata and Carpaccio pizza. There are also pizzas with black dough, but also more classic ones such as Quattro formaggi, Pepperoni and Capricciosa. The menu is also rich in sections for breakfast, salads, pasta and risotto, meat and all the way to the irresistible sweets. Choose tiramisu, warm apple crumble or blueberry pie with coffee or wine for a perfect finish of your meal.",

Also, Puter is one of only a few restaurants in Belgrade that make with fine bistro cuisine, and practically the only one that is completely oriented towards French specialties. We can say that Puter Bistro is unique on the Serbian hospitality scene. The menu changes seasonally, and the proximity of the Kaleni\u0107 market ensures top quality food at any time of the year. The offer includes authentic French specialties such as foie gras with smoked veal tongue, rabbit rillette with date gel or pithivier, a traditional French savory pie filled with oxtail in demi-glace. Among the main dishes, you will find veal pressed between layers of potato mille-feuille, served on mushroom carpaccio in a delicate velout\u00e9 sauce, duck legs with prunes and Brussels sprouts, or quail on mashed potatoes in rosehip sauce. An excellent selection of fish with an original approach to dishes will delight those who love monkfish medallions with collard greens, sardines in sumac tempura, red porgy on cauliflower and anchovy cream with beetroot and apple salad, or shrimp thermidor with white radish and leek salad. This is one of those menus that will keep you coming back to Puter. Of course, everything is in perfect conjunction with extremely charming and professional service, an excellent wine list and an elegant and pleasant atmosphere.",

The main dishes include rich salads, interesting pastas with homemade sausages or Saint\u2013Denis with steak, as well as meat dishes. Plates of cheese and meat products inspired by the Mediterranean, or bruschetta with cheese and honey, prosciutto or salmon go well with a glass of fine drink. The street level patio offers a special pleasure during warm summer evenings, when the drink menu is enriched with interesting gin and tonic combinations with herbs and citrus fruits.",

        "Review": "This old restaurant stands out as a unique gastronomic destination for lovers of horse meat, especially horse steak. Although pared down, the menu has been popular among generations of diners for nearly four decades. The star of the menu is the steak tartare, served with toast, butter, pickles, and onion rings. Steak is also served on a board with fries, sausage, tenderloin, liver, or a combination of grilled meat. The space is small and charming, with authentic rustic decorations that create a warm atmosphere in combination with wood. The staff is known for their kindness and cordiality, both towards regular guests from the neighborhood, and towards guests who come from different parts of the world.",

At lunchtime, there is a menu option with three courses, and with five or seven courses in the evenings. The spectacular wine list will give your experience a special dimension and, if desired, the possibility of pairing food and wine. Expect a bold and exciting gastronomic journey through Serbian cuisine. Discreet and very friendly staff are there to carefully present each dish, preparation technique and ingredients, and the way of serving leaves an exceptional visual impression. four lovely forms are a greeting from the kitchen\u2013homemade cornbread with pumpkin seed butter, tartare in a cone, jellied pork on zucchini and burek with lamb and red star. The first of the seven famous courses is white corn mush with fried ajvar from Leskovac peppers. It is followed by a reinterpretation of homemade brioche popara with a crunchy u\u0161tipak, stew with quail meat and pumpkin panna cotta, and then an imaginative representation in the form of beans with matured kulen espuma and veal sauce. Traditional sarma is transformed to sauerkraut jelly and yoghurt ice cream with an old type of cereal. This is followed by an effective minimalist beef rib eye, with aged garlic and potatoes. The pre\u2013dessert is chamomile, white chocolate powder and raspberry ice cream, and the dessert is so fine on the palate.",

The sidewalk garden is part of the Dor\u0107ol chic, while the interior is modernly elegant. The menu opens with small bites, suitable both as an option for larger groups and as an opportunity to try more interesting combinations. We chose a playful palette of flavors \u2013 smoked eggplant and caramelized mushrooms on toast, duck confit croquettes with creme fraiche, excellent gravlax salmon on sourdough blinis with pickled onions and roast beef on toast with arugula, and horseradish mousse. Lamb bayadere and Serbian burrata, grilled goat cheese on burek crust, veal tartar with mint, and roasted pepper puree are also part of this introductory magic. Soup with buckwheat noodles and coriander is plentiful and hearty, and in the main part, don\u2019t miss the famous roasted kale with red cabbage puree, which Endorfin was the first to introduce in Belgrade. We also recommend fresh tagliatelle with Mangalica bacon and asparagus. Homemade gnocchi with sage and butter, risotto with Fru\u0161ka gora mushrooms, chicken drumstick in prokupac sauce, and duck breast with orange cream and beetroot are also attractive. Seasonal tiramisu with raspberries and home\u2013made ladyfingers, and a powerful dark chocolate and hazelnut cake served with vanilla ice cream round off the pleasant atmosphere. Endorphin is undoubtedly a true representative of gastro\u2013style bistronomy.",

        "Review": "Franz by TT is one of a series of lifestyle projects that have sprung up in Belgrade recently. At the core of the concept is a relaxed bistro style for the young and, of course, for those who feel that way. The menu is refreshingly different from what we are used to in Belgrade, and the food is excellent, aesthetically pleasing and, on top of that, unpretentious. The attractive cocktail menu includes interesting combinations of well-known flavors, as well as some non-alcoholic mixes such as lemonade with raspberry and sage, or apricot and almonds. All parts of the menu and beverage menu are very concise and seem to hit the mark. There is a quality breakfast based on pancakes, waffles, but also Shakshouka with spinach leaves, and from the meze selection we recommend fried brie cheese with berry sauce, as well as the Olivier salad. Of the main dishes, you will enjoy wonderfully spicy pasta with prawns, lime and mint, good homemade beef goulash stewed in beer and served on mashed potatoes. We also recommend salmon steak with fennel on orange puree. The selection of wines is very interesting, but also extremely limited. It is worth mentioning that all wines are also available by the glass.",

        "Review": "Close to Knez Mihailova Street, there is a favorite place for gourmet that testifies to the timeless appeal of Belgrade kafanas. Tables covered with red checkered tablecloths and waiters in white shirts evoke a part of history with a view of the bustle of modern Belgrade. Traditional Serbian cuisine is on the menu, from delicious grilled meat to hearty goulash, as well as homemade broths and cream soups. Each dish is a tribute to flavors and traditions passed down through the generations. Here it is best to try the classics such as \u0107evapi, pljeskavica and Kara\u0111or\u0111e steak. Be prepared for generous portions and complete your enjoyment with a glass of homemade brandy or a refreshing spritzer with soda and Serbian wine.",

A visit to The Square restaurant is a hedonistic feast in every detail, sip, and bite.

Greetings from the kitchen come as a cute scone with crackers and cream, and a delicious scone with butter. The Olivier salad arrives in its deconstructed version, consisting of bars and purees of basic ingredients such as carrots and peas. Next is a great kavurma with brioche, dried apricots, and a kajmak\u2013based dressing, accompanied by a lucid savoury shiso leaf in tempura. The questioning of tradition continues through two magical versions of burek \u2013 with cow\u2019s cheese and kajmak, and with Bu\u0161a meat, foie gras and grated truffles. All this, and more, is part of the unique Experience menu. On the regular menu are Square classics, ranging from Bolognese to steak tartare to burgers. The gastronomic journey through the landscapes of the modernized and shifted Balkan cuisine continues with perfect lamb meat served in a rich sauce based on white chocolate, apple, pear and tonka beans, effectively accompanied by a roll on sauerkraut. Gin and pear sorbet will prepare your palate for the sweet part with a famous selection of European stars. Mille feulle, and especially Pain perdu get only flattering marks for the magical mix of aromas and textures.",

A classic of every good local tavern, fried pepper stuffed with cheese, in this case it is a conscious choice of the best ingredients paired in an adequate way.

In a wonderful old building from 1926, just below the Kara\u0111or\u0111e Park, with a modern interior and an elegant design, Gilda has a brief menu with a representative selection of precisely executed dishes in which the sumptuous aroma of quality ingredients comes to the fore. It opens with a selection of exceptional Damini delicacies, as well as attractive marinated fish carpaccio, authentic vitello tonnato and excellent burrata with caramelized tomatoes. Quality olive oil and a great selection of pastries are the perfect accompaniment, while the playful fritto misto selection with onion and garlic mayonnaise transports you directly to Italy. Among the pastas, fresh fettuccine with homemade sausage and broccoli will catch your attention, and we were completely won over by the subtle ravioli with mushrooms, great artisan cheeses, sprinkled with hazelnuts. The veal tagliata lavishly demonstrated a knowledgeable approach to the selection and preparation of meat, and the selection of cutlets and ribbed Rubia steak are the inspiration for this section of the menu. On the other hand, there is a good selection of Adriatic fish, as well as grilled octopus and shrimp. The service is professional and discreet. Original tiramisu, effective cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and chocolate fondant consistently close the hedonistic circle that finely combines the charm of the Mediterranean and the taste of Belgrade.",

The impressive interior is decorated with a large statue of the golden Buddha, and the striking design of the space continues in the pleasant garden. A carefully designed menu opens the door to unusual tastes and combinations that will surely be a pleasant surprise. There are specialties such as spicy tuna tiradito with a mix of togarashi sauces, jalape\u00f1o and yuzu truffle ponzu, fried squid with a sweet-spicy dressing and notes of chili pepper and mint, or summer truffle chicken gyoza with shiitake mushrooms and teriyaki sauce. In the soup section, traditional tom yam soup with fine pieces of shrimp, squid and mushroom or exotic ramen soup with coconut milk awaits you. Lovers of vegetarian specialties will have a wide choice here - from avocado sushi rolls to quinoa salad, to fried tofu with black bean sauce. Of the main dishes, don\u2019t miss the juicy steak from the wok or the provocative homemade red curry pork ribs. There\u2019s also five-spice BBQ chicken. Don\u2019t skip various sushi creations, such as crispy crabs or spicy tuna rolls, are also an unavoidable part. To spice up the concept of the offer, there is also a rich selection of steaks with a range of sauces. The sweet corner offers excellent bayadere with praline and sesame, or coconut raspberry cake.",

        "Review": "This is the oldest kafana in Belgrade, with a century old tradition. The outdoor part has a view of the Serbian Orthodox cathedral, and the interior reflects the spirit of old times. The menu includes traditional specialties such as prebranac and stuffed peppers, juicy \u0107evapi and pljeskavice, and there are also dishes with the famous Serbian fermented cabbage, from Sarmi to stewed sauerkraut. Fresh homemade buns are an additional delight, which go perfectly with kajmak. You can have a homemade rakija as aperitif, and finish with traditionally brewed coffee that goes well with traditional sweets such as orasnice, pies or dumplings. The rustic interior with low wooden tables contributes to the authentic experience of a real Serbian kafana.",

        "Review": "Everything is said when you say Fran\u0161. An indispensable name on the gastronomic map of the capital is remembered for the harmoniously arranged garden, interesting quotes and wine showcases in the interior, as well as for the well-coordinated team of discreet and cordial waiters. Fran\u0161 is a frequent choice for celebrations, so be sure to make a reservation, regardless of the time of day or year. The extensive menu skillfully and harmoniously combines national and international, traditional, and contemporary, in dishes that adhere to high standards in every respect. A selection of local delicacies is a logical choice to start with, as well as very nice homemade pies. As soon as you settle down, a selection of hot pastries and an interesting couvert arrives on the table, which includes a serious selection of olive oils and spices. Ask what seasonal potages they have, and an unusual mix of celery, beetroot and prunes was excellent. Furthermore, listen to the recommendations of the friendly waiters. In addition to the rich meat menu, on which we highlight the juicy Fran\u0161 packages, there is also an excellent selection of fish, while generous and creamy pastas are especially highlighted. One section is dedicated to truffle dishes, and there is also a lean, vegetarian section. The list of desserts is separated in the electronic edition of the menu and offers an irresistible choice - from tulumba filled with vanilla ice cream, over sumptuous cakes like Remy Martin or cake with fresh raspberries, tiramisu, and cr\u00e8me brulee, to a great trilogy of chocolate mousses and pancakes in multiple versions. It is the right choice for many people and is the first choice for all occasions.",

This urban bar with a minimalist concept is popular for cocktails and a light dinner after work or with friends. A great selection of food and drinks awaits you in an ambience of refined elegance. The concept was born from the rich experience of the owner of the restaurant, previously involved in numerous successful gastronomic projects in the Serbian capital, and here it got its full glory and is surely stepping into the waters of high\u2013class and quality hospitality. A carefully created menu, which seasonally follows the best tastes and presents them in selected delicacies, will certainly not leave you indifferent. The cold dish offers bold options such as tuna tartare, chicken pate with pear in wine sauce, goose liver terrine or prawn carpaccio. If you want to play it safe, there are the stars of the restaurant \u2013 boned chicken from the oven, lamb legs with mashed potatoes and spinach, an exceptional piadina with homemade ham or one of the delicious pastas or risottos. The enjoyment will be rounded off by desserts such as homemade bayadere or original tiramisu. The best tastes are accompanied by over one hundred well\u2013chosen labels of the best domestic and foreign wines.",

        "Review": "Whether it\u2018s hot summer months when you can enjoy on the large patio adorned with olive trees and wooden details, or the cooler weather when you sit in the warmth of the bar gently swaying on the river, the Corso raft is definitely a place to enjoy on the Novi Beograd quay. A wide selection of wine labels, which are available in an impressive number by the glass, cocktails, domestic and international spirits, as well as excellent mixes of squeezed juices, will be pleasant if you stop by for a break after a walk or bike ride. If you are in the mood for a light lunch, there is a wide selection of sushi rolls, salads and sandwiches. Thinly sliced tender pieces of steak in a crispy crust, topped with a simple, delicious pumpkin seed sauce, make an excellent warm appetizer. Chicken pate and Lyon quenelle are highly recommended. For lovers of the classics with a little twist, there is also sweet foie gras with strawberry jam. Then a series of pastas starts, among which we would single out osso bucco Bolognese, an interesting innovation of the classic, and spaghetti served with slow\u2013cooked beef shank and bone marrow in a creamy red sauce. For gourmets, there is the must\u2013have pulled pork, shank with mlinci, burgers and veal in kajmak sauce, which is truly the trademark of this restaurant. In addition to sushi, fish specialties include salmon, tuna and perch. For dessert, we tried an excellent cake made of four types of Belgian chocolate, with a creative name \u2013 4d cake!",

In addition to the classic fruit fillings with plums and apricots, there is a large selection of unique combinations \u2013 from domestic and exotic fruits to chocolate, caramel and coconut combinations. The queen of local dumplings is the decadent Queen Mary, with perfectly combined flavors of walnut cream, walnut kernels, cocoa, caramelized walnuts, roasted hazelnuts and almonds, followed by the Princess from Madagascar, in which combines silky vanilla cream with white chocolate, mascarpone and biscuit. Interesting aromas and textures dominate among the savory flavors as well. The selection of hot chocolates on a stick is also unique.",

For starters, Suvobor offers shredded cracklings, cornbread, kajmak, cheese and deep-fried peppers stuffed with cheese. The main dishes are kafana classics, from grilled meat to a wide selection of cooked dishes - goulash, sarma, moussaka or a rich portion of baked mlinci with smoked pork shank. Finally, along with brewed coffee, sweets remain true to tradition - srne\u0107a le\u0111a, urma\u0161ica or apple pie close the gastronomic circle of Suvobor.",

A luxurious wine list and a list of premium alcoholic beverages harmoniously accompany the unique culinary creations. We recommend one of the tasting menus - meat, fish or a menu that combines the best of both selections, and there is also an \u00c0 la carte selection. From greetings from the kitchen, through exceptional sourdough bread, to dessert, each plate is a small work of art, precisely executed, visually effective, and sensational on the palate. The magic starts with homemade pastries with truffle- flavored butter, followed by crust cones with shiitake mushroom and Parmesan filling, mushroom cream and beer hop foam creatively served in an eggshell. The rhapsody of flavors continues with tender, seasonal potages, and powerful pheasant consomm\u00e9 with floating chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9. Then, on the one hand, a subtle smoked greater amberjack tartare served on a refreshing cucumber and celery jelly, and on the other, an intense crispy pie with truffles and Pirot cheese. The feast of gastronomy continues with desserts. Green tea frothy cream with crumbled fermented fig leaf and coconut ice cream are there to coat the palate, and then they are won over by Paris\u2013Brest with hazelnut cream and ice cream from caramelized kajmak.Exceptional!",

In the evenings, the experience is rounded off by live music, and their inspiring menu provides enough reasons to explore and pair tastes, starting from creative cocktails to predominantly Serbian wines on the wine list. Warming up comes with sharing plates, walnuts that give a seductive note to rolled plums, and apricots paired with pistachios, while magical nuances are introduced by the famous gyoza. As a starter, salmon is served in gravlax or tartar option, there is also baked burrata and falafel, black risotto, and gnocchi with Mangalica meat. Modern national grilled meat is represented by pljeskavica with Miro\u010d cheese, and on the other hand, baked tripe, goulash with gnocchi and kajmak, and veal head in tripes, baked with Parmesan cheese. We tried an interesting dish, liver stuffed with red onion jam, prunes, and hazelnuts, on carrot and apple puree and mighty aged roast beef in an intense sauce with four types of peppercorns. Flamb\u00e9ed beef neck, rolled duck, rolled sea bass, pork belly, and pig cheeks sous vide, are equally captivating with their modern execution and presentation, and the friendly staff knows what to recommend. Finally, the deconstructed Vanilla slice with raspberry liqueur reduction, served in a wine glass, along with baked delicate lime cheesecake, topped with homemade blueberry jam, are just a confirmation of the playfulness in every segment of the menu, the beverage menu, and the entire concept.",

        "Review": "One of the more interesting boutique hotels in the heart of Belgrade can boast a restaurant with a modern and urban concept as part of its offer. During the day, the atmosphere is intended for city meetings, business lunches or moments when you just want to enjoy the peace, and the evenings are dedicated to good times, nights out to be pampered by the professional staff of the bar with an excellent offer of cocktails, and music for a good atmosphere. Although the kitchen is oriented towards a quality bistro offer in terms of ingredients, preparation techniques, gentle fusion of elements of world cuisines as well as presentation, it remains simplified enough to nicely round off the needs of the hotel as well as the concept of the restaurant itself. Everything we tried was extremely tasty, beautifully presented and served with a smile. An excellent wine list as well as the bar offer are one of Pavillion\u2019s strengths. On the menu, in addition to several excellent vegetarian and vegan options, you will find most of the specialties from the bistronomic all stars team - duck fillet, lamb shank, beef cheeks or osso bucco, which we welcome as gourmets and lovers of this selection. It seems that there is a growing trend of using demiglace in more places on the menu, which we noticed here as well. In the announcement of the new menu, they have the opportunity to surprise the guests with a new interesting sauce.",

        "Review": "This Casa Nova restaurant in Dor\u0107ol tempts with a seductive combination of Italian and French cuisine. As soon as you step into the romantic ambiance of the restaurant with many hidden corners,you will be greeted by friendly staff who are here to fulfill your wishes. The menu itself is structured in two sections. The first section is simply called Light, and here you will find a variety of appetizers such as juicy parmigiana di melanzane or rolled mozzarella with pesto sauce, and you will also find the soups you shouldn\u2019t skip, such as the tomato soup with pistachios or stracciatella, or clear chicken soup with dumplings made of Parmesan and parsley. Light bites also include selected fish, like fresh salmon with asparagus or smoked trout, a salad meal or salad with a meal. You must not skip one of the great risottos - with truffles, shrimp, vegetables, or homemade pasta where you choose one of the six pasta options offered. The second section is called Fine Menu, and it offers various meat options. We recommend duck in berry sauce or turkey in gorgonzola sauce. The steaks are simply an explosion of taste in this menu section. Whether it\u2018s a steak served on arugula, with porcini mushrooms or in a spicy cognac and pine nut sauce, green pepper or maybe red wine and raisins, you should try one. Round off your experience with a lemon tart or a chocolate mousse. From the good selection of wines by the glass, choose one to pair with the dessert as well.",

In accordance with its slogan, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t been to Vuk, then you haven\u2019t been to Belgrade\u201d, it is still a place visited by many tourists and visitors passing through Belgrade. This is partly due to the excellent location in the downtown pedestrian area, with two beautiful patios on two streets, and partly to the sense of history and tradition that lives in every plate served. Their classics, such as veal schnitzel, veal pilaf, stuffed peppers, or garden patience rolls, are made lavishly, honestly and from high quality ingredients, and above all, standardized by vast experience. The old, experienced waiters will pamper you with the top service that you expect in this type of restaurant and that many of us love and appreciate. Don\u2019t forget to enjoy the people sitting next to you because it seems like every table has its own story to tell, and at the same time it\u2019s as if they are all united by a secret.

Every meal is a real feast because the food comes in generous portions, from starters to desserts. Selected dried meat products and cheeses as a classic Serbian snack or fried stuffed peppers are among the cold and hot appetizers. The main dishes are dominated by grilled meat, but also veal and potatoes under the sa\u010d, prepared in clay pots covered with charcoal. Pork bayadere are a must! Along with a wide selection of refreshing seasonal salads, the aroma of hot homemade buns is captivating, and the meal is nicely rounded off by classic and seasonal delicacies.",

Refined ambience with a luxurious aquarium in the middle immediately tells us that we are in a place that is different, special. Friendly and accommodating hosts who welcome guests with a wide smile only reaffirm the impression of uniqueness. The menu and carefully selected wine list open wide the door to complete enjoyment. Whet your appetite with gourmet delights like baked goat cheese with light homemade fig jam or a steak roll in a delicate pumpkin seed sauce. Tease your palate further with a great selection of risottos, with chicken and peppers, prawns and saffron, or with mushrooms. A great selection of meat and fish from the Josper oven is not to be skipped, and the only question is what to choose between irresistible pieces of steak in olive oil that melt with every bite, tomahawk or black\u2013angus steak, and salmon or tuna. For lighter meals, there are creatively designed salads, salad with grilled prawns and quinoa, or salad with steak and cranberry balsamic vinegar. Complete a perfect meal with a sweet treat \u2013 chocolate souffle, homemade cheesecake, or a sweet and sour apple cake that pairs well with vanilla ice cream.",

You won\u2019t often see Cacio e Pepe pasta on Serbian menus, so we recommend that you taste it here, it\u2019s excellent. Do not miss the opportunity to try the pizzas. The rich selection of meat in the display case and ripening chamber is tempting. Along with serious pieces of meat, you choose your own side dishes and sauces, which are expertly prepared in the Mibrasa charcoal oven and strikingly served in front of the guests. Ranging from T\u2013bone, rib eye and medallion, to juicy lamb chops, pork ribs and unusual sausages with jalape\u00f1o peppers, all the way to Wagya and Black Angus steaks, you will have a completely unique experience rounded off by a wine list with more than 120 labels.

        "Review": "Located on Zemun quay, Pa\u0161a is one of those restaurants where everything is good. The view of the wide Danube is priceless, regardless of whether you are sitting on the terrace or in the cozy interior. Everything on the small, but obviously carefully designed menu is delicious\u2013 both river and sea fish, as well as meat specialties and everything from the grill. The first dish is the inevitable spicy and rich fish broth, followed immediately by bruschetta with rolled goat cheese or with vegetables in a pesto dressing. Turkey with mlinci is the highlight of the offer, just note that it arrives in a portion for two, and it is enough for three or four hungry persons. It takes a while to prepare, but it is worth the wait. On the meat side of the menu, there is excellent barbecue, and our favorite is Deda \u0106ira\u2019s pljeskavica, followed by homemade sausages and pork fillet in a bacon crust, but also T\u2013bone steak, filet mignon, and beef chop. If you want seafood flavors on the river, Pa\u0161a Plata is an excellent choice, with a mix of grilled octopus legs, mussels, shrimp and squid, and seafood risotto served in the middle of the table. The Danube story is presented by the Pa\u0161a plate on which perch, carp and trout are served. You can order each one of these as a separate dish, and we draw your attention to trout fillets in caper and almond sauce, or sea bream in lime and dill sauce. Finally, the apple cake is a must.",

The core of the gastronomic experience is the beef, which is roasted so that the center is juicy and full of flavor. From the standard burger with cheddar cheese, to the local burger with Serbian Miro\u010d cheese, perfect for grilling, there is also the Double smash burger and the youngest, decadent Truffle Bro with truffle. It has truffle and hazelnut oil, truffle carpaccio, plus truffle sauce. If you want to step out of the burger section, we recommend the crispy chicken, or the veggie cheeseburger. Homemade or sweet potatoes, crispy onion rings or fried mozzarella are the perfect accompaniment.",

To make sure you try a little bit of everything, there are meals that combine different rolls, from 16 to as many as 56 pieces.

        "Review": "Lorenzo i Kakalamba is a very special sensory experience indeed. From the entrance you encounter a visual cacophony of interesting furniture together with motifs of Pirot rugs appear in combination with a life-size Terminator sculpture. It sounds crazy, but it actually works! The very concept of the restaurant is based on a combination of Italian and local cuisine, with a special focus on Pirot specialties. Although the menu puts an emphasis on meat, from Pirotski \u017de\u0161\u0107i Lu\u010di\u0107 to a selections of aged steaks, do not miss the opportunity to try the excellent marinated salmon carpaccio. This is a refreshing prelude and a perfect combination of delicate pieces of marinated salmon and crunchy fresh cucumbers with pine nuts that add another dimension to the texture of the dish. If you are looking for a lighter dinner, try the handmade ravioli filled with pistachio cream and pecorino cheese. The combination of pasta, filling and creamy sauce will gently hug and comfort you. Duck fillet and chicken fillet stuffed with truffle mousse are a treat in themselves. Complete the pleasure with a selection of Serbian and Italian wines, and when you are ready for dessert, the waiters will show you a huge board with pictures of desserts. The chocolate sphere is visually attractive, but the real gem among the sweets is the seemingly simple Tres leches prepared to take you back to your childhood and add another layer of taste. Dinner and a show \u2013 that\u2019s what they would call it in Hollywood.",

        "Review": "Surrounded by the greenery of Ko\u0161utnjak, with a spectacular view of the city, Rubin defines itself as a place of fine local cuisine, a long tradition and an enviable reputation. An elegant interior, discreet and more than pleasant service, a respectable wine list and a great selection of premium drinks make Rubin a unique place, special in every detail. In the summer season, especially on weekends, you need to make a reservation for a table in the garden. On Fridays and weekends they have live jazz music, so we advise you plan enoughtime and not rush anywhere. An absolute recommendation for starters is the steak tartare. In the introductory part, there is also a selection of meat and dairy delicacies, interesting baked kale, deep\u2013fried celery and porcini stew. Glazed cheeks are rightfully one of the specialties of the main menu. They are perfectly tender and served on celery puree. We also recommend the crispy Mangulica bayadere on pea puree, with pickled onions. Z\u00fcrich\u2013style medallions are another favorite, and in addition to national grilled specialties, there are also tripes, mu\u0107kalica, roast veal and cutlet, duck fillet with sweet potato and drumstick in port wine sauce. The tray with sweets is brought out at the end of the meal, it will not be easy to decide between the Raffaello cake, the chocolate sphere or the raspberry gratin, while the Paris\u2013 Brest and the interesting, sweet mix in a jar left a great impression like everything we have tasted here.",

        "Review": "You will find a true oasis of Mediterranean cuisine in the Ruzmarin restaurant, located near the Central Garden residential complex. The menu puts an emphasis is on Greek and Italian cuisine. With a refined, bright interior with lots of glass surfaces, Ruzmarin is an excellent choice for short business lunches, as well as for longer food enjoyment. At the start, don\u2018t miss the homemade breads, but be careful \u2013 it\u2018s easy to start with them, but it\u2018s hard to stop. The menu also includes a slightly different chef\u2018s steak tartare, well done and interesting, grilled cheese from the mountain Rtanj as a combination of local ingredients and a Mediterranean approach to cheese, as well as Italian bruschetta and Greek grapevine leaf rolls. For those who go in the direction of a lighter meal, a meal salad is the usual choice on the menu. There are interesting combinations in the risotto and pasta section, and we recommend the gnocchi with turkey and baby spinach. Here you will eat good Mediterranean squid prepared with an interesting combination of potatoes and spinach, but also slow\u2013cooked lamb shank, so tender that it will melt in your mouth. They also have a good selection of steaks, and Italian specialties, such as saltimbocca. A special offer is a Spanish suckling pig, which according to the Spanish tradition is cut with a plate, but to enjoy this delicacy you need to make an appointment the day before.",

        "Review": "Mali pijac is situated in a house that is a cultural monument. It boldly combines the styles and techniques of French and Serbian cuisine in the manner of a modern Parisian bistro. Hearty onion soup that you simply cannot skip and real homemade beef soup with dumplings will warm you up. In the introductory part of the recommendations are lucid beef tongue carpaccio with pickled red onion, slaw, and berry vinegar, as well as chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 with blackberry jam and onion butter. P\u00e2t\u00e9 is served with magical homemade sourdough bread. Relying on the local and seasonal is one of the hallmarks of the kitchen, so we tried the perfect asparagus risotto, and even better kale in sauerkraut sauce on purple sweet potato puree. The menu also includes delicious potatoes with young kajmak and chive oil, pasta with truffles, and duck on apple and orange puree, while the Mali Pijac pljeskavica, Mangalica fillet and veal sweetbread in demiglace sauce are a nice tribute to the local cuisine. Everything is accompanied by a well\u2013designed wine list with Serbian and French labels, as well as a long list of cocktails. An impressive presentation and a fine harmony of flavors raise the experience to a higher level, and it is rounded off by the indispensable Cr\u00eapes Suzette, as well as the baklava with pistachios, which they are proud of, served with milk ice cream. Precise execution, charming approach both in the kitchen, as well as in the ambience and service make this place one of the favorites.",

Mezestoran Dvori\u0161te, as its name suggests, relies on an extremely rich menu full of different mezzes that become a rich gastronomic experience when combined with a good selection of domestic wines available by the glass. The menu is made up of an interesting combination of different Mediterranean cuisines, a few local specialties, with a hint of Turkish cuisine specialties. We recommend you try beets with walnuts in a mild yogurt and lime sauce. The extremely simple, but perfectly harmonious, dish will refresh you and prepare you for everything that follows. Lahmacun, a dish with lamb, rich in herb and spice aromas of the Middle East, is another must.Bavette Mare Monte, a dish with fresh mussels, prawns, courgettes and cherry tomatoes, is an impressive gastronomic and visual experience. And the Izmir kebab, juicy and tender meat, perfectly seasoned and served with a refreshing combination of tomatoes, onions, and yogurt on a crusty pita bread. As a slightly gentler option, they have salmon fillet served with bulgur, almonds, and vegetables, with an extremely creamy, almost silky orange, lemon and ginger sauce that gives the fillet a breath of freshness. If there is room left for dessert, we recommend the vanilla slice, big, deliberately chaotic, a bit messy, visually noisy, and fundamentally excellent.",

In an elegant classic interior, or in a very pleasant summer garden, the restaurant offers the same atmosphere to its guests all year round. The menu is designed in a way that it takes the best of local cuisine, combining it with selected classics of the world gourmet scene. The diverse selection opens with appetizers such as juicy steak carpaccio served with a fresh dressing of basil, rocket, Parmesan, and crunchy roasted almonds. In a trio of mushrooms, the aromas of porcini mushrooms, button mushrooms and oyster mushrooms alternate one after the other, and the menu also includes several creamy risottos. For the next bite, choose one of the refreshing salad meals, such as the one that combines figs in red wine, iceberg, and goat cheese, or one with homemade pasta. In the main specialties section, gourmet bites await you, such as pork medallions blended gently with prune sauce or Mediterranean turkey in an interesting combination with pumpkin seed dressing. Salmon La boh\u00e8me offers slightly lighter and equally exotic flavors with a whirlwind of mango, prosciutto, cucumber, and paprika. The note of enjoyment will be completed by some of the desserts, such as the classic or summer version of Opera cake or, perhaps, cooked wheat with ground hazelnuts.",

        "Review": "Sheher Park Cafe is a great choice if a few of your friends want to go for a drink, and a few would still like to eat something. A true hybrid of cafe and restaurant, this place with a fantastic garden has an extremely rich drink menu with wine labels from various geographical regions, as well as a mixed and rich selection of spirits and cocktails. There is also an enviable selection of nonalcoholic drinks, pressed juices, and premium coffees. The cooks place a serious emphasis on the brunch option. Breakfast is represented by eggs Benedict, omelets, and scrambled eggs. This is followed by a variety of oatmeal and sandwiches, and the Tuna Melt is truly special for all the senses. The series continues with a delicate dinner salad, and we warmly recommend the Thai Shrimp. If you\u2018re in the mood for a bite to eat while sipping fantastic cocktails, there\u2018s an exceptional selection of perfectly balanced pizzas. Sheher pizza with parmesan cream and smoked rump steak is praiseworthy. There are also exceptional pastas, such as excellent gnocchi in truffle sauce, which you can enhance with pieces of steak. Madre mio, Premium Salmon and Teriyaki Glazed Tuna are the absolute stars of the kitchen and it\u2018s really hard to choose a favorite. Be sure to leave room for dessert and try classics like Apple Crumble or Tiramisu, but also a very gentle and refreshing Kiss based on mascarpone cheese with Nutella and seasonal fruit.",

Family tradition, superior skill and infinite creativity are in croissants with savory and sweet fillings in the morning. The main stars are elegant cakes with rich cream and juicy seasonal or exotic fruits. The decadent Gotham Twist is an irresistibly airy mousse with hazelnuts, the Mille Feuille has seasonal variations, and the VeGe cake perfectly combines hazelnuts, raspberries, and chocolate. Several types of ice cream with unusual and refreshing flavors are offered in summer. Mandarina also has attractively designed gift packages of biscuits, pralines and chocolate bars with mandarin flavors.",

        "Review": "Restaurant \u0160aran, located on one of the most beautiful parts of the Zemun quay along the Danube, has been an iconic venue for years and is the first association for everyone when you think of fish, Danube and Zemun. As in any serious restaurant, people come to \u0160aran for several reasons, the main one of which is certainly the top-quality offer of fresh river and sea fish, and seafood. Although restaurants of this type opt for very simple preparation, because the emphasis is on the quality of the food, here on the menu you will find specialties such as Vojvodina style perch fillets - baked in pasta, with smoked cheese and poppy seeds, or interesting combinations such as top-quality tagliatelle with vongole, porcini mushrooms, shrimp, and tomato jam. There is no need to emphasize that the daily offer of fresh sea and river fish is wide. Other, no less important reasons that make \u0160aran a superior gastronomic destination are certainly the beautiful atmosphere of the old Zemun house, decorated with taste and warmth, and an excellent offer on the wine list, followed by good recommendations from extremely friendly and professional staff. Shrimp, octopus and shrimp tartare, swordfish or tuna carpaccio, smoked carp p\u00e2t\u00e9 or swordfish prosciutto, famous fish stew prepared according to a century-old recipe, buzara, risotto and lobster, crispy fish cutlets, medallions and fillets, everything that you can and you can\u2019t imagine is prepared in the Zemun fish temple.",

        "Review": "This place is special in that you won\u2019t go wrong whether you\u2019re in the mood for a cocktail, sushi, or a specialty from the Far East. Sakura is modern space with Asian details, and it has a menu made up of a wide variety of cuisines from the Far East. They emphasize visual presentation - expect every dish to be extremely Instagrammable! Yes, sushi is the expected choice, but specialties that will stay in your memory for much longer are also on the menu. For example, Korean Kimchi Tuna, which is most reminiscent of tuna tartare, additionally raised with kimchi and crunchy pieces of vegetables that build on the creamy structure of the tuna and bring a special sour\u2013spicy pleasure in every bite. Sprouts and broccoli will intrigue you, as well as Nasi Goreng, Pad Thai, or tempura specialties. Saint Jacques and grilled vegetables in sweet Sakura sauce and Hoisin Salmon are a real treat for seafood lovers. Stir fry duck with dried chilies and Szechuan pepper brings waves of pleasant spiciness, but also the specific taste of Szechuan, a truly special bite for gourmets. If you like Asian classics, there is Bulgogi or sweet and sour pork. Be sure to leave room for sweets! You will enjoy it if you choose homemade ice cream, we chose excellent sweet potato ice cream, or soft bites of sticky rice.",

        "Review": "The famous Avalica has preserved the bohemian spirit and atmosphere, with thoughtful refreshments both in the ambience and on the menu. It is located across the street from the Red Star Stadion, next to a beautiful garden that is far enough from the street and has a pleasant interior. Avalica is spacious enough for larger gatherings and tucked away enough for more intimate occasions. A display case with a good selection of wine labels perfectly accompanies the menu here, not too long, but quite inspiring and based on tradition in a modern edition. Homemade bread with two types of spreads arrives as a couvert, for starters we recommend a hearty soup, and to warm up meze Avalica or light zucchini rolls filled with creamy goat cheese served on tomato cream, with nuts. In the main part, we tried an interesting \u0106evap in Stambolov\u2019s style, where \u0107evapi are served in a bun with warm satara\u0161. Juicy beef shin with mlinci au gratin and tender marinated pork ribs are also in the offer. The menu includes a daily offer of traditional dishes \u2013 dock patience rolls, potato stew and beans. In the Old Serbia section, there are veal head in tripe, and Leskovac mu\u0107kalica. Sweetbread and homemade sausages arrive from the grill, as well as beef cheeks, duck breast, and rib eye steak. Vanilla slice, impressively served in a glass with seasonal fruit, and modern Poljubac Avalica with nutella and mascarpone stand out on the list of desserts. A harmonious blend of experience and youth sets this place apart from others.",

        "Review": "Restaurant Babaroga is one of the few Belgrade restaurants organized as a steakhouse and fully dedicated to working with top quality cuts of meat. Upon entering the restaurant, you are greeted by a powerful bull sculpture that suggestively announces that the experience that awaits you here will be powerful. In a modern and warmly decorated interior as well as in a large garden in the warmer part of the year, you will enjoy a complete portfolio of meat - from pork, lamb to beef that has undergone the dry aging process, to a large section in the menu dedicated only to steak lovers in various forms. From raw tartar and carpaccio to Wellington, and steaks in the most popular sauces. In the premium steak section, you will find Angus beef as well as the highest quality Japanese Wagyu beef, which is respected globally. A large selection of standard cuts of meat - ribeye, steak, T-bone, is also enriched with some that have not become standard in Serbia but have an important place, such as tomahawk or picanha, which is served in smaller portions and is suitable even if you drop in alone, and very much in the mood for a good and tasty piece of meat. The meat is technically expertly processed, so you can rely on your piece of meat to be prepared exactly as you have requested. The excellent wine list is sorted according to the tastes you will enjoy and will nicely accompany your every gastronomic idea of enjoyment.",

The dough is soft, airy, with a crispy crust that is the result of perfect baking, and special attention is paid to the ingredients, providing a unique combination of flavors and textures. There are ten pizzas on the menu. Naturally, the classics \u2013 Margherita and Capricciosa, and for cheese lovers Siciliana with mozzarella, Grana Padano, gorgonzola and Provolone cheeses will be an excellent choice. Invigorating tomato soup served with baked pizza dough is also on the menu. For dessert, the choice is simple, the exceptional creamy tiramisu with pistachio cream \u2013 ideal for sharing.",

        "Review": "Klub Ko\u0161utnjak is one of the few places in Belgrade with expertly prepared game meat. Surrounded by greenery, with a beautiful covered garden, away from the traffic and crowd, this restaurant offers an idyllic feeling of being in nature, while the interior is classically decorated. Hunter\u2018s pate and hearty pheasant soup are our recommendation for starters, and we suggest that you continue on this trail and try spicy hunter\u2018s sausages, or intriguing dishes with wild boar or deer meat with a characteristic side dish. The menu includes goulash, hearty Kara\u0111or\u0111eva steak, good medallions with mushrooms, and the usual national repertoire from the grill, salads are seasonal, and the service is \u201eold school\u201c. The wine list includes labels from Serbia, and desserts include homemade pies (cherry, apple) and hazelnut pie served with a scoop of ice cream and whipped cream.",

        "Review": "Restaurant Plezir, tucked away under the canopy in lower Dor\u0107ol, is one of the newer restaurants specialized in fine bistro cuisine. Using techniques and knowledge from the world of fine dining, they manage to raise their dishes to a level where enjoying food becomes an art - from dealing with combinations of flavors, textures, considering presentation and ways to raise the guest\u2018s experience one level higher. An elegant interior, luxurious, and at the same time relaxed, with lots of wooden details, is inviting and it is associated with hedonism. And Plezir offers hedonism in abundance. The menu changes, but some dishes have already acquired the status of classics and deservedly keep their place on it. Be sure to try two interesting tartars. One is with three types of sea fish with black roe, perfectly seasoned and refreshingly sumptuous, and the second tartar is duck breast with goose liver, an original dish that we have not had the opportunity to try in Serbia until now. High-quality pasta and risotto intrigue with their unusual combinations. Among the main dishes they offer horse steak, slow-cooked lamb, and pork cheeks, and in the fish section all the favorites - grouper, octopus or common sole in various combinations. Lovers of good food have something to enjoy. Their now iconic dessert - marzipan and dark chocolate cigar is as Instagrammable as it is delicious.",

An interesting interior with discreet oriental details, a sidewalk patio, staff who can explain and recommend menu items all make an original way to get acquainted with the great tastes of Asia. For starters, try the Flavor Bomb, where you roll peanuts, lime, caramelized onions, chili peppers, and a few other exotic ingredients into a leaf of lettuce. The rich Pho is a must, both a soup and a filling meal, with coriander, noodles, vegetables and slices of beef or chicken. In the further tasting, the favorites are sweet and spicy pork with peanuts, ginger, and fried onions, great buns - excellent with cod, as well as duck, and some of the dim sum combinations - prawns, pork, chicken, vegetarian. Sweet potato or kimchi are unusual accompaniments, and when you get to the main course, don\u2019t miss the excellent mi thit bo, beef and rice noodles in oyster sauce, which is highly recommended. Among the main dishes are bibimbap and pad thai, excellently prepared classics of Far Eastern cuisine, red curry with duck, and green curry with vegetables. For a sweet ending, try the attractive pineapple sprinkled with spiced salt, fried banana with peanuts, coconut, and biscuit, and there\u2019s also tapioca pudding and mango caramel. An interesting list of cocktails completes the authentic experience of the East with all the senses.",

        "Review": "In the heart of Senjak, where the city pulses at a calm pace, Rustique, brings the Italian soul and flavors of Italy right to your table. This corner, adorned with a warm atmosphere and excellent food, is one of the favorite destinations for anyone looking for an authentic Italian experience. In the extensive menu, you can find a real range of tastes - from authentic Tuscan pastas with a rich porcini mushroom and steak ragout, to juicy steaks, and specialties such as veal saltimbocca or Milanese cutlets with mashed potatoes. But what makes this restaurant special are, of course, the pizzas. Roman style, with a thin crust and plenty of ingredients, each pizza becomes a small ode to the Italian way of life. The selection of pastas and risottos offers interesting combinations, among which we like linguine with gambori, octopus and capers, as well as casarecce with mortadella of protected geographical origin and pistachios. For a sweet ending, don\u2019t miss the pistachio souffle! Rustique is not only a place it well, it is also a corner to exchange anecdotes, laugh loudly, a gathering place of hedonists. Certainly, it\u2019s no wonder that this place is often the first option for lovers of Roman-style pizza and for all those looking for a good bite in this part of the city.",

        "Review": "Lovac is famous for its offer, service and as a gathering place for journalists, celebrities, and bohemians. In the heart of Vra\u010dar, a wonderful, patio under the canopy and a discreetly revamped interior with hunting details are the environment in which national and wild game specialties come to the fore. Everything will be presented to you by the experienced and friendly staff. Potage made from forest mushrooms is truly unique, with an intense taste, made with Parmesan cheese, walnuts, and raisins, deserves every recommendation. Given the name and reputation, be sure to ask what wild game specialties are on offer. The sausages are nicely spicy, the rabbit with cauliflower and broccoli in a demi-glace sauce is an unusual creation served with barley risotto, and the offer also includes venison steak, wild boar in a cream sauce with truffles, as well as hunter\u2019s basket and venison medallions. Kara\u0111or\u0111e steak is a safe choice from the classic repertoire, \u0107evapi are a simple, but also an excellent choice if you\u2019re in the mood for grilled meat. In this part of the menu, \u0106umur is attractively served on your table, as well as gourmet u\u0161tipak and pljeskavica in lamb lungs. Tito\u2019s vanilla slice will take you back to the past, and in the sweet section there are also baklava, tulumba, urma\u0161ica and chocolate walnut cake. Tradition has been preserved here to a fine extent, and that is something to be especially praised in this region.",

        "Review": "A place that has shaped the social life of Belgrade for decades, the famous Francuska 7; the history of art and politics was created by the guests who sat at their tables, and today it is an intriguing, modern restaurant that nourishes tradition, creatively presenting it in new forms and techniques. The interior was renovated, yet it has preserved its patina, while the marvelous garden is a real jewel in the center of the town. If you choose from the classic menu, first try the gibanica, which takes about 25 minutes to prepare. It arrives on a wooden board, the waiter cuts it in front of you, and it melts in your mouth with an intense cheese flavor. The taste of gibanica goes well with Mangalica sausages and homemade ajvar. Great onion soup with pine nuts and raisins is an unusual variation of a classic, while a crispy lamb pie served with quince jelly is an exciting interpretation of tradition. Lamb roast with southern ragout and mint sauce, Mangalica chops with vodouvan paste and fennel cream, Pe\u0161ter veal, and impressive duck with a crispy roll, are challenges in the meat section. If you are into fish, we recommend Danube perch or Adriatic Sea bass, turbot with vermouth sauce, or risotto with octopus and crispy squid, with light saffron sauce. Each dish arrives imaginatively served with the clear signature of the chef. Among the desserts, the breakthrough is the modern Maccura cake made of coconut, mango and passion fruit, and the obligatory, famous Buda\u2019s Vanilla slice, which brings back old memories.",

        "Review": "Refined and prestigious, Magellan is the right choice for an exciting and unique gastro cruise. It conquers with elegance both in the interior and in the beautiful garden. Once you are comfortably seated, all you need to do is let the friendly staff recommend, present, and serve their guests with care. The sumptuous wine list with over 200 labels, and an impressive selection of alcoholic beverages and cocktails also contribute to the overall experience. The complete atmosphere is provided by the Set menu in five or eight gangs. For starters, an excellent and attractive steak tartare is indispensable, as well as foie gras and octopus with roasted peppers, burrata with pesto, and smoked sea bass carpaccio. A novelty in the fish section, swordfish, is precisely prepared and harmoniously combined with roasted cauliflower and sun-dried tomato sauce. You can also enjoy seafood soup or beef consomm\u00e9, as well as a selection of pastas and risottos. Juicy and tender sous vide veal on expertly prepared Robuchon puree with butter conquers with a powerful harmony of flavors. Sea bass with basil foam, turbot in frankincense sauce or perch with kohlrabi cream in the fish section of the offer, and duck fillet, warm goose liver, lamb back or some of the steaks in the meat section, present new gastronomic horizons. Desserts from the Paradise Island section are named after their key ingredient \u2013 coffee, coconut, mango, nougat, sour cherry or strawberry. The desserts play with forms, textures, colors, and tastes.",

        "Review": "Restaurant GIG is a new project of an already experienced group of restaurateurs, which is the only one of their projects dedicated to haute cuisine. The restaurant is based on the principles and values applied to successfully manage for years the Imperator winery, which is owned by them. These are the principles of biodynamic production, which in the case of GIG is reflected in a full commitment to the quality of ingredients, dealing with their origin and growing vegetables in their biodynamic garden. Also, the same principles apply in the responsible approach to sustainability, the use of free- range animals, game and fish that live in their natural habitats. The exceptional wine list, in addition to wines from the Imperator winery, also includes some of the most interesting wines of the world scene, a selection of magnum bottles, natural wines, and exclusive labels that you can only find in their restaurant. In addition to the main tasting menu of 8+ courses, there are no less interesting vegetarian, fish, and caviar menus for two. We also recommend a great wine pairing with a tasting menu that will elevate your experience to the highest level. A beautiful interior decorated with natural materials as well as authentic, interesting details, such as water placed on crystals, to absorb good energy, as well as extremely friendly and dedicated service will take you out of your busy everyday life and lead you on a path of relaxation and enjoyment.",

        "Review": "The Zlatar restaurant has been a place for good national cuisine for many years, mostly oriented towards specialties from the Zlatar mountain region. A warm tavern atmosphere and experienced waiters jointly guide you through a beautiful evening, which is often complemented by the sounds of live music. The extensive wine list is commendable because there is no kafana without wine, and there is no kafana without rakija, and here they offer 31 versions of their own production. The entire stretch from U\u017eice to the Zlatibor and Zlatar mountains produces good food for appetizers, so don\u2019t miss tasting various prosciutto, fillet, Zlatar cheese with a protected geographical origin and different types of kajmak. In the winter period, there are also pork aspic with good homemade sauerkraut, and steak tartare. Buckwheat pie, as one of the iconic Zlatar specialties, is certainly not to be missed. You can warm your stomach with veal or lamb cream soup and beef noodle soup. Veal under sa\u010d is certainly one of the favorites of the local guests, and there is also braised goat in milk, shoulder in sauerkraut or lamb under sa\u010d. Tasty potatoes from the same sa\u010d accompany the tender and tasty meat, while a ball of kajmak is there to add heartiness for gourmets, although the selected pieces are just right - not too lean. A wide selection of grilled specialties completes the offer as well as cooked daily meals, so be sure to ask the waiter for a recommendation.",

        "Review": "Close to both Belgrade and Pan\u010devo, Mali Raj is a pleasant oasis worth escaping to from the hustle of the city. The beautiful large garden and the interior offer a truly special experience. The extensive menu includes the national standard offer, international classics, seafood and fish, and their famous specialties. We recommend starting the meal with excellent grilled cheese, and they also offer meze and a Mali Raj big plate, as well as salmon carpaccio and shrimp cocktail in cognac and dill sauce. To warm up, veal and fish soup, homemade broth with noodles or minestrone, and then the complete national repertoire from the grill. Followed by turkey with mlinci in gorgonzola sauce, steak in sauce with three kinds of mushrooms, Wiener and Pariser schnitzel, beef stroganoff, Leskovac mu\u0107kalica, and chicken with honey and wild berries. In the fish section, there are squid, stuffed and fried, deep\u2013fried crabs, salmon, and Grand Marnier prawns. Favorites are singled out at the very beginning of the menu, so don\u2018t miss out on trying the Opanak, minced meat stuffed with prosciutto, bell pepper, and cheese, topped with chicken and kajmak, or the Monastery chicken deep fried in walnuts. You should also consider the daily recommendations, including head in tripes, grilled liver, venison stew, lamb shins, cooked veal, and beef shin on kajmak. Finally, a classic selection of classic desserts, tufahija and baklava, pancakes and walnut meringue, chocolate tart or fig cake in summer.",

Their pizza has been one of 50 best pizzas in Europe for several years in a row. The most popular variations are the Margherita, followed by the unusual Mortadella e pistachio, with a pistachio pesto, Provolone, mortadella, basil and crushed pistachios that are a wonderful contrast to the soft dough. Chia is a pizza with the famous Pirot cheese made according to a traditional recipe, and for the perfect spiciness there is Pizza Diavola with Ventricina sausage. They also serve potages, sandwiches and salads, and the drink menu features local producers of beer, rakija, gin, and wine.",

        "Review": "Classy, exclusive, and luxurious, Jerry offers a complex and complete fine dining experience in every respect. Well-coordinated staff, selection of top-quality food and ingredients, and an impressive list of spirits and a rich wine list make a visit to this restaurant a unique hedonistic experience. The guests are won over on their first step, when hot chopsticks and a selection of breads arrive at your table, together with goat cheese from their farm in Homolje, olive tapenade and chive spread. The persuasiveness of local flavors is confirmed by the powerful hand-cut steak tartare with pine nuts, served with aromatic butter, perfectly matched by the effective deep-fried goat cheese balls with almonds and served in a spicy sweet-hot sauce. The menu also offers Wagyu and Black Angus steaks, as well as lobster and fresh fish from the Adriatic. Creamy Arborio rice risotto with saffron and shrimp represents part of the menu, which also includes excellent foams with tomato, steak, and pomegranate. In the meat section, we draw your attention to lamb back and baked rib eye with flamb\u00e9ed gnocchi, an interesting combination of tomahawk steak and marinated chanterelles, and veal cheeks with chive puree. Tuna from the Josper oven and salmon with teriyaki sauce are in the fish section. The impressive wine list adequately represents Serbia and exclusive world labels. In the sweet section, two favorites stand out - an attractive gianduja dessert, and a brilliant mille feuille with forest fruits.",

Kalemegdanska Terasa offers a gourmet pleasure, and it will wake all your senses in a pleasant way. The terrace has a glazed part, and the view stretches out unobstructed before you, while you enjoy the food and the wines from the carefully selected wine list. Because of all this and because of the tradition, which is an obvious motif in the menu and in the decoration, this is one of the most beautiful restaurants in Belgrade. You won\u2019t go wrong if you opt for dishes of traditional French gastronomy, such as the excellent creamy goose liver terrine, served with crusty bread with cranberries and silky fig jam and steak tartare, or for local traditional bites, such as warm crispy pie with tender cheese, served with ajvar and Serbian meze. The stewed veal served with creamy mashed potatoes with truffles is so tender that one can eat it with a spoon. We recommend the irresistibly tender beef cheeks. If you are in the mood for something more substantial, and you plan to dine with a larger group, roasted lamb shoulder with ratatouille in Tamjanika sauce is a great choice. For a lighter dinner, we recommend baked octopus and seabass or grilled perch fillet, with perfectly crispy skin, and for dessert \u2013 floating island!",

Located in a salon\u2013type apartment in a quiet street, near the center of Zemun, its existence is hinted at only by a small inscription on the building\u2019s intercom. Once you step inside and help yourself to cold water and a strip of quince confit, you will have the feeling that you have come to the home of an old friend, with an interior decorated in an eclectic style, combining modern and retro. Friendly staff headed by a chef will make your fine dining experience memorable. The menu changes every few months and is reduced to a maximum, the dishes carry interesting names, yet the choice is such that everyone can find something. In the current, colorful menu, where the dish symbolizes an explosion of colors, flavors and harmonized aromas, the appetizer paradise opens the colorful harmony. It\u2019s a mix of sundried cherry tomatoes and melon balls, with dried, crispy bu\u0111ola (Capocollo), served in a cream cheese sauce, with the addition of olive oil and essence of ramsons. The following gourmet pleasure is summed up in three words \u2013 coin coin coin. It is marinated duck breast, with a side of grilled asparagus, demi\u2013glace sauce with pine nuts, Dijon mustard and, to top it all, a piece of goose pate.

Perhaps it is most pleasant to come here during a late breakfast and try the excellent panta rei sandwich with prosciutto on brioche bread. If you want to eat lunch, dive into the starters first. The steak parmesan bagel is truly a wonderful experience! Our advice is to order the steak medium rare so that you can really feel all the flavors that this dish has to offer. Then indulge yourself in the wine list and the flavors of the Mediterranean. You certainly won\u2018t make a mistake, whether you choose the Pazin gnocchi in a fine cream of truffle, turkey and pecorino, or you choose the risotto with saffron, prawns, asparagus and pecorino. If your gourmet mood goes in the direction of something more substantial, go for the pork shank with mlinci and mushrooms. In that combination, you\u2018re really not sure what will melt in your mouth first. We recommend the slow\u2013roasted boned pork ribs, so soft that you can eat them with a spoon, as well as the spectacular veal under sach in milk. There is also a truly exceptional selection of Mediterranean fish that can be grilled for you.",

        "Review": "Considering the long tradition, everyone knows the Sin\u0111eli\u0107 restaurant. Next to the football field of the Sin\u0111eli\u0107 soccer club, this is one of those traditional restaurants where you\u2019ll find everything you\u2019re looking for. There are experienced, quick, and skillful waiters, a wide selection of national specialties that comes out of the kitchen, and a harmonious atmosphere that successful restaurants of this capacity exude. Although spacious, Sin\u0111eli\u0107 is usually full like a beehive, especially on weekends, yet everything flows smoothly. For starters, we suggest the Sin\u0111eli\u0107 snack, or deep\u2013fried breaded peppers stuffed with cheese, together with quality rakija, and the choice is good \u2013 salad like Sjenica bell peppers in sour cream, or grilled chili peppers in oil and garlic, followed by veal soup or beef soup with noodles to warm up your stomach and then you can choose something from the large selection of main dishes. If you prefer lighter food, there is a hearty salad, risotto and pasta. For those with a stronger appetite, or perhaps hungrier, we recommend grilled meat, aged steaks, chicken, turkey and veal specialties, as well as the national pride \u2013 sa\u010d. The specialties of the house are Sin\u0111eli\u0107 saber with three types of meat, \u010ca\u010dak \u0107evap\u010di\u0107i and u\u0161tipci. Don\u2019t miss the dessert, because you will surely like some of the cakes they will present in front of you.",

The main feature of the menu is interesting and authentic dishes that combine the best of European and Indian cuisine.

For the main course, there are different types of curries, from vegetarian to meat options, daal, biryani, paired with roti, basmati rice or seasonal chutneys with crusty bread. Spicy bites go well with home\u2013made Indian lemonade with soda water and raspberry puree, with a touch of salt.",

Goose liver is a must for gourmets, and celery with anchovies for vegetarians. Then go for the redesigned burek with mortadella and pistachios or baked bone marrow, and after a few glasses of wine and a chat, you\u2019ll be ready to continue your journey through the local attractive menu. Every pasta on offer is at the level of excellent Italian past, and we especially recommend the ricotta gnocchi. For fish lovers there is grilled salmon and tuna, and the meat lovers will not go wrong with a choice of veal, burger, steak, \u0107evap, or sausage.

The friendly, professional, and pleasant staff will escort you to your table where excellent olive oil and various goodies are already served, and you can enjoy them with excellent homemade bread. When choosing from the minimalistic but very deliberate menu, be sure to check with the staff, because they often have some new and exciting dishes that are not listed on the menu. Of the permanent stars of the menu, be sure to start with beef tea, or panko\u2013breaded celery. The extremely thinly sliced celery becomes creamy, and the perfectly crispy panko breading that envelops it provides an exciting contrast in texture. You can\u2018t go wrong with pork ribs bayadere, Old Scholl veal cutlet, or veal shank in supr\u00eame sauce. Each fiber be separated with a spoon, while the sauce has an almost silky texture, and even the classic mashed potatoes as a side dish are prepared in an excellent way. A seriously prepared classic indeed! Consider also Sicilian\u2013style prawns, sea bass tartare with tzatziki cream, and charcoal\u2013grilled octopus leg. Whether it\u2018s seafood, or selected cuts of meat, this restaurant prepares them without fail. After all, until the next experience, treat yourself with Opium ball or a French Kiss.",

        "Review": "The team of experienced restaurateurs who enthusiastically took over the management of the Stari \u017eabar restaurant a few years ago has justified my trust. Everything that the guest enjoys - from the ambiance, services, wine list and menu - has been raised to a higher level, while at the same time \u017dabar has not lost any of the charm that I love so much. Certainly one of the most beautiful locations for lunch with a view of the river and a traditional destination for enjoyment can boast of an exceptional quality of service. Professional and elegant, yet warm and relaxed at the same time. A large part of the specialties on the menu are now well-known classics whose quality is talked about. There is, first of all, the famous turkey with mlinci, smoked steak and tuna, as well as the traditional \u017dabar apetizer with warm buns to start, as well as our favorite - octopus with pistachios covered in butter. As for meat, we recommend veal filet and duck leg, excellent duck breast, and lamb and veal cutlets. The position on the water means that \u017dabar serves excellent river and sea fish. It goes without saying that the friendly waiters will give you a quality recommendation. To round off the enjoyment, there is an extremely wide and well-selected wine list from which you can easily pair wine with food. For the very end, don\u2019t miss Grandma Dara\u2019s refreshing fruit cake.",

The well\u2013informed staff will take you on a tour of the impressive selection of wines, and then recommend and agree with you on the best strategy and choice to accompany your meal. From the name of the restaurant, it\u2018s obvious that steaks are a specialty here, so you can\u2018t go wrong with the choice of steak. The meat is top quality, the excellent team of chefs knows how to cook it to perfection, and we suggest you ask for medium rare. Before you indulge in the wonderful flavors of steaks, be sure to try the tartare. Steak tartare La France is an exceptional classic with a creamy texture and perfectly balanced spices. Apart from beef, there are two other types of tartare \u2013 horse meat tartare and fish tartare with avocado. It\u2018s great that they have tartare in half portions, and you can combine two flavors on one plate. As a lighter alternative, there are excellent handmade pastas with truffles, veal, or prawns, as well as an excellent steak salad. We recommend you try the aged \u0107evapi on kajmak that melt in your mouth, and each bite is a perfect combination of an extremely soft structure and the finest taste of beef meat.",

        "Review": "The former kafana was carefully preserved and revamped into a pleasant national restaurant. It has been in the same location for almost a century, carefully nurturing and respecting the Serbian culinary tradition. The large indoor space has an interestingly designed section with a wine offer, one hall is non-smoking, while the spacious garden is nicely hidden from the busy street. The service is fast and efficient, the offer is based on meat favorites presented in the spirit and style of the new age, and live music adds to the atmosphere. To begin with, there is a hearty cold snack, and for warming up, a non-standard hot and sour tomato soup with smoked cheese, and a hearty white cream soup with veal and chicken breast. Of the hot appetizers, we draw your attention to chicken liver with caramelized red onion, rolls with aromatic cr\u00e8me fraiche, and pasta with steak and porcini mushrooms. In the Traditional Serbian section, you will find grilled meat, mu\u0107kalica and Kara\u0111or\u0111e steak, gratinated hunter\u2019s schnitzels and juicy smoked pork shank in horseradish sauce with pasta. Next comes the specialty section, with chicken and turkey in several versions on one side, and steak and tomahawk steak on the other. Somewhere in between are excellent ribs in sa\u010d, and lamb and veal chops. The sweet end is rounded off by an interesting cream cake with ice cream and sour cherry topping, tiramisu with pineapple and quince, vanilla slice with berries, orasnica, cold pancakes, or warm chocolate souffle.",

The offer includes traditional delicacies \u2013 pancakes, small cakes, baklava, cooked wheat or chestnut pur\u00e9e with whipped cream... In addition to the famous Moscow schnitte, which has been a symbol of this place for decades, as proof that pastry chefs keep up with the times, there are also modern desserts inspired by the latest world trends, as well as vegan and raw treats.",

        "Review": "Located in an old, elegant villa near the Vukov Spomenik, this restaurant will immediately evoke memories of summer, the smells and tastes of the sea, and the sound of waves. The friendly staff will welcome you warmly with a sincere smile, the Dalmatian way. If you want intimacy and a unique experience of being served in a private room of the villa or, on the other hand, premium wine pairings, an excellent selection of labels that the tavern offers, along with a specially created menu, the hosts will gladly indulge you. The carefully designed menu hides pleasure in every bite. Try the juicy, grilled prawns in a sauce of soy, onions and peppers that go well with mashed potatoes with cuttlefish ink, or the seductive cod in bianco, served on homemade crostini. For risotto lovers, the true delicacy is creamy risotto with fresh or smoked seafood and steamed vegetables. Leave room for the main catch - grilled octopus tentacles, soft inside and crispy outside, with garlic dressing and a vegetable side dish, a combination you don\u2019t want to miss. If you want to experience a Dalmatian delicacy that is not a gift from the sea, they have excellent prosciutto, Pag cheese, or pa\u0161ticada with meat and gnocchi that melt in your mouth in perfect harmony. The desserts in Tata Mata workshop, served at request, will round off your visit.",

The menu is broad enough to make an interesting walk around the world. We chose to start our meal with excellent, traditional Parmigiana di Melanzane, and an intriguing baked mushroom julienne cream, served with toasted bread. Among the starters are tartares - steak and tuna, carpaccio and Mangalica delicacies, and bruschetta, sauteed wild mushrooms and squid a la Andaluc\u00eda. If you prefer pasta or risotto, we recommend tagliatelle with prosciutto and truffles, or risotto with Arborio rice and seafood. The selection of specialties includes steaks in various options, and our attention was drawn to the excellent Skvodorovka, an attractively served Russian dish, impressively spicy combination with pieces of beef fillet, aromatic potatoes, onions, and mushrooms. Tuna with sesame and pepper and teriyaki salmon, sea bass and sea bream, Mediteraneo prawns, and grilled squid are the main offerings in the fish section, and duck with honey and apricots, veal cheeks in polenta and Zerak chicken in the meat section. Finally \u2013 Oscar Wilde & Dorian Gray. The first is an imaginatively served Belgian chocolate cake with blueberries and chopped hazelnuts, and the second are creamy pancakes filled with mascarpone cheese, whipped cream, and dried fruit, and topped with orange syrup.",

        "Review": "The extremely colorful and vibrant ambiance of this iconic restaurant will instantly convey the spirit of South America to you. The shabby chic design of the restaurant fits perfectly with the pleasant promenade in front of the Beton hall and the view of the river. Whether you are in the mood for a quiet lunch paired with some fine wine or for an exciting dinner with music and a quality cocktail, Cantina de Frida can handle both situations with equal quality. In addition to the selection of cheeses and prosciutto, we recommend tapas. We single out those with excellent crispy squid, which will be phenomenally accompanied by cold draft beer, and excellent kalamata olives in a salsa of dried peppers and cumin. If you need something to warm you up, then Peruvian soup with prawns and glass noodles is the right choice. Of course, we cannot venture into the gastronomy of South America without recognizing Asad, a traditional technique of grill preparation that recognizes food as a social event and the most important factor of enjoyment. Carefully selected pieces of meat, from T\u2013bone steak, rib-eye steak, and even octopus to slightly smoked chorizo sausages with a Spanish mixture of spices, with a special grilling method become mouth\u2013watering bites. From a rich selection of wine labels from all over the world, you can choose a wine according to your affinity. But if you are in the mood for something quick and tasty, there is a wide range of Tex\u2013Mex cuisine such as tacos, burritos, fajitas and of course, burgers.",

        "Review": "Durmitor is the place to go for spit-roasted meat. Delicious, and juicy veal, lamb, and goat meat has been prepared here from its opening until today. Make a reservation, both for a table, and the roast. Conveniently hidden in the central part of New Belgrade, with the interior part on the upper floor, this restaurant has been extended to a large and very pleasant garden. In the morning you will have a choice of substantial breakfast options, and in lunch time, do not skip the excellent veal soup. In any case, our recommendation in the introductory part goes to the local steak tartare, serious, convincing, and nicely spicy, and next to it, there are selections of meat delicacies and cheeses, as well as deep-fried oyster mushrooms and bell peppers with cheese. Apart from the famous, already mentioned roast, the main menu offers meat in all forms. Tuna steak, salmon, trout, and squid represent the fish segment of the offer. Everything is accompanied by a serious wine list, which is dominated by Serbian and regional wines. The local steak in olive oil is famous, the attractively served Kara\u0111or\u0111e steak is a frequent choice, and we also recommend the marinated neck and lamb pljeskavica. They prepare everything in order on the grill, while the selection of steaks is separate in the beef section. In the sweet section, depending on the season, they offer au gratin raspberries or tangerines, and tres leches, poppy seed cake and homemade vanilla slice are also recommended.",

For years, this place has been attracting guests with its pleasant atmosphere and menu. Hand\u2013made gnocchi with different flavor combinations stand out. You will enjoy light gnocchi on butter, sage, and parmesan, gnocchi in red ragu or in gorgonzola sauce. When it gets cold, come here for the famous goulash in beer with crispy puff pastry. If you crave smaller bites, there are delicious tapas and light salads. The offer of the day includes potages that change regularly to reflect the freshness of seasonal ingredients.",

It is a synthesis of all the elements of modern hospitality: effectively designed interior, table setting and service, and well-coordinated and trained staff. And, naturally, a signature menu and a carefully designed wine list. The tartar is expertly prepared, perfectly tasty, and served with homemade brioche, capers, cucumbers and pickled onions, and an aioli sauce to manage the spiciness. Duck liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 or duck rillettes are also tempting appetizers, and don\u2019t skip the sumptuous bouillabaisse with mussels, sea bass and prawns. In the pasta and risotto section, land and sea are skilfully combined. Tortellini with ricotta and pesto, sprinkled with almonds, and linguini with large prawns in pistachio sauce. Black risotto from Adriatic cuttlefish and ribeye stand out as distinctive specialties of the house, the JAM burger is attractively served under a cloche, and homemade sausages and Mangalica cutlet are a fine tribute to the local cuisine. Ask which Adriatic fish is on offer, and don\u2019t miss the perfectly tender duck with celery puree and barley risotto. An intriguing list of cocktails and a wine list that boldly cruises through Serbia and various meridians harmoniously pairing tastes. The rhapsody continues with chocolate tart sprinkled with sea salt and blueberry cake with lemon balm and lemon. Imaginative and magical, no less.",

The unpretentious interior is complemented by the pleasant and friendly staff. The waiters are warm and caring professionals, you will feel you are having lunch with dear friends. The cuisine is based on local Balkan specialties, all of which are skillfully twisted or turned upside down in such a way that they become completely new specialties. While you browse the menu, whet your appetite with one of the specialty cocktails. Crispy buckwheat rolls filled with cheese and drizzled with honey and sprinkled with walnuts are an unreal game of paradoxes- simultaneously hot and cold, crunchy and creamy, sweet and bitter-salty. Don\u2019t miss the beef buns or the magical crispy fried beef legs. Continue intriguing your palate with the perfect pork bayadere, or homemade gnocchi with calf\u2019s brain in an exquisite oxtail sauce. Spectacular vegetarian dishes in the Balkans? O yes! You will remember celery root confit in celery and truffle cream for a long time! A delicate and creamy dish, where the bold aroma of celery blends very finely with the aroma of butter and truffles. Round off the experience with cauliflower cake or homemade gnocchi prepared with plum stone flour. These gnocchi are playing with the deconstruction of grandma\u2019s favorite delicacy - plum dumplings.",

In their case, modernity implies a certain freedom in the interpretation of dishes and evokes a sense of cuisine fusion. This is certainly the most logical approach to the Balkans as a gastronomic destination. Most of the menu is served in a smaller portion format, which we enjoy because it gives us the opportunity to try more different specialties. The offer includes interesting cauliflower popcorn with a secret dressing, a baked flatbread filled with hummus and cheese, bell peppers with crumbled cheese and kalamata olive jam. Don\u2019t skip gibanica served on yoghurt with a gentle touch of mint. It is perfect! Followed by a few classics from the specialty section, such as their popular monastery chicken deep fried in almonds and walnuts, Mediterranean-inspired lamb meatballs, but also classic \u0107evapi served with finely chopped onions and spicy paprika. Spicy pljeskavica enriched with roasted peppers and then coated with demi-glace, classic Kara\u0111or\u0111e schnitzel or Ambar \u0107evapi sprinkled with mature cow\u2019s cheese served on vegetables are among the main dishes and will be a challenge even for gourmet guests.

A rustic ambience, with pictures of old Belgrade, and a spacious terrace on the river adds a relaxing note to the homely atmosphere. A glass of rakija will whet your appetite just like reading the menu, where the national cuisine is based on meat specialties. As a warm appetizer, we recommend crispy rolls in an intense combination of goat cheese, prosciutto and peppers. Do not skip burek pljeskavica served on burek dough, one of the specialties here. A juicy pljeskavica with kajmak arrives on an interesting base decorated with urda urnebes. If you\u2019re looking for something lighter, we suggest Zlatibor chicken baked with chopped peppers and prosciutto in a kajmak sauce. Make sure you ask what\u2019s on the menu from roasts and daily cooked dishes. Pork neck and ribs, shredded pork loin, \u0107evapi and excellent sausages, \u0160umadija opanak and rumpsteak in olive oil with cheese kept in animal hide (me\u0161ina) continue the local gourmet series, which is complemented by the \u0161opska or moravska salad in the summer, and sauerkraut, pickles, and homemade ajvar in the winter.

There are almost 30 different flavor combinations on the menu, from classic to those with a Serbian flavor such as Grande Serbia with garlic, bacon, and kajmak. Pizza specialties of the house are Taurunum and Bresaola. In addition to pizzas, the menu has an interesting offer for breakfast, followed by bruschetta, risotto, pasta, sandwiches, and a salad meal. Serbian specialties are represented by \u0107evapi on kajmak, sausages and pork ribs. Homemade craft beers go well with every bite. For dessert, we recommend tres leches cake or pancakes gratinated in royal sauce.",

Be sure to listen to the advice on which rakija will whet your appetite and be sure to ask about the wine selection, because the menu is impressive. We recommend the homemade chicken p\u00e2t\u00e9 with black truffles and fried dough. An excellent creamy p\u00e2t\u00e9 with a gentle aroma of truffles, combined with fried dough that is crunchy and soft at the same time. Of the other appetizers, of which there are plenty, we suggest a variety of home-style snacks, then pearls of European cuisine such as goose liver terrine, steak tartare, or smoked salmon terrine. They also offer creamy soups and homemade soups with dumplings or homemade noodles, just like at grandma\u2019s. They are followed by the classics from the grill and the classics of the restaurant itself. From excellent Kara\u0111or\u0111e schnitzel, to grilled pork medallions with mushroom sauce and, of course, the star of Madera\u2019s menu, the famous lamb kapama with sour milk that is served on Sundays. You should not skip some of the specialties such as duck breast on green pea puree, duck cracklings, or sous vide lamb shank, which practically melts in every bite, followed by river and sea fish, as well as seafood, among which we highlight the excellent octopus served with beetroot puree. The octopus, crispy and creamy at the same time, together with the contrast of the pink puree presents an exquisite artistic delight.",

The offer goes from focaccia with prosciutto to Bresaola and Dassi with Italian prosciutto and Mortadella with pistachio cream. The meat & fish section is divided into two segments \u2013 Italy, the classics in our way, which represents all famous Italian specialties, and Carni locali, where there are attractive pork bbq ribs, artisanal sausage, and Verde steak. The meat from the Mibrasa charcoal oven is the finest steaks such as Japanese Wagyu, black Angus, and st. George\u2019s lamb. The menu also includes pastas, and all of this is harmoniously accompanied by a wine list dominated by labels from Italy and Serbia.

        "Review": "On the very bank of the river, next to the Pan\u010devo bridge, the konoba Kod Goce i Renata is a good destination to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city, as it is equally close to Belgrade and Pan\u010devo. The large, rustically decorated garden and the beautiful interior are a pleasant environment and being on the riverbank and overlooking the city across the river give everything an extra relaxing touch. A rich and mildly spicy fish broth is a must for starters, and fish p\u00e2t\u00e9 and crispy zucchini fried in panko breadcrumbs that arrive on a large wooden board stand out as appetizers. Furthermore, you need to decide whether you prefer fish, river or sea, or meat specialties. The fish is prepared in the disc or on grill - ask what is fresh from the catch. We tried delicious sterlet, which is not always available, there are also perch, carp, and catfish. Along with river fish, sea bream and sea bass represent the sea beautifully. Grilled squid is the dish they are famous for, which was confirmed when we tried it. Spaghetti with seafood worthily represents the pasta section, which also includes spaghetti with shrimps and pasta with prawns and parmesan cheese. In that part of the menu, there are black, red, and white risottos, and the vegan menu is separated. If you\u2019re into meat, everything is here, from grilled specialties to Kara\u0111or\u0111e steak and beef steak. Tres leches, baklava, and tulumba are suggestions for the end, to nicely round off the whole atmosphere by the Danube River.",

Particularly popular is the pizza by the meter, which combines three pizzas from the menu. Pastas and risotto are among the favorite choices, and for meat lovers they have juicy turkey Saltimbocca and veal in a parmesan crust. The dessert section is dominated by tiramisu, but also cakes with chocolate, cheese, or fruit. The restaurant is always full, especially on weekends when people come here to enjoy the flavors of Italy and the relaxed atmosphere.",

A place full of stories, visited by historical figures and everyday people in search of a simple chat, as well as the famous Moskva \u0161nit cake, which is certainly one of the most famous Belgrade hotel rituals of many generations. Under the leadership of its new Chef, the \u010cajkovski restaurant has recognized in the right way some of the important catering trends, above all the importance of the origin of ingredients and promoting their local geographical features. The menu offers goat\u2018s milk cheese from the village of Gunjaci, or \u0111ubek, a cheese made from steamed dough, originating from the dairy school in Pirot. We welcome this because relying on the quality of the food, which cannot exist without a relationship to the origin, together with culinary knowledge and techniques, is the only real solution for quality food. The menu also includes international specialties from Italy, Greece and France framed in an original, mature, and meaningful concept of the capital\u2018s hotel restaurant. With the sounds of a concert piano, you will enjoy quality service and good food at one of the most central locations in Belgrade.",

It is located in the center of the city, with a hidden patio and elegant interior with carefully selected furniture and decorations. Be completely spoiled by the gastronomic offer of food and drinks in this restaurant. Start your adventure with light starters, such as aromatized prawns with Taggiasca olives and capers on polenta, or Coquille St Jacques with parmesan and artichokes. One of the creatively designed salads or traditional Italian soups can be your next step of pleasure. For full enjoyment, there are the best pieces of meat and fish such as Angus steak in Barolo red wine sauce with mashed potato and caramelized red onion, veal steak medallions in black truffle sauce with homemade gnocchi, or salmon and asparagus on lemon cream. The premium selection of dishes is accompanied by meticulously selected wines from the Apennine peninsula and a top selection of domestic and foreign spirits. Don\u2019t forget to leave room for dessert and a good espresso, because the pleasure is not complete before you taste the rhapsody of flavors of the pistachio-raspberry cake or the chocolate decadence. For a moment, you will wonder who needs a trip to Italy when its selected flavors can be tasted right at Gallo Nero.",

Friendly staff will welcome you here, where you can really hide from the rest of the world and indulge in the top flavors of the Far East. As you browse the colorful menu, be sure to order the Crispy Edamame first, a special twist on the famous Japanese classic. Each edamame is individually fried in tempura and seasoned with truffle oil. If you decide to have a lighter meal, there is an excellent meal of Wakame King Crab salad or Quinoa Edamame salad. The kitchen offers four excellent tartares \u2013tuna, salmon, steak, and sea bass, and you can modify the spiciness in agreement with the waiter. Once you\u2018ve chosen your flavor, they\u2018ll serve it on buckwheat bread, or nori seaweed in tempura we can recommend. In addition to excellent gyoza and spring rolls, there is a wide selection of noodles, wok combinations, and various tempura specialties. Whether you are in the mood for fish or meat, the choice will not leave you indifferent. Tuna in several ways, we single out tuna in pepper, or the European\u2013 Asian mix: Tuna Wellington. There are also variations on the theme in Teriyaki sauce, as well as excellent steaks and T-bone steaks. You can combine all this with a truly excellent selection of wines and very drinkable Asian beers. If there is room for dessert \u2013 their bayaderes are famous for a reason.",

Start your gastronomic experience with a specially designed cocktail, and our recommendation is Is it Safe, which arrives on the table on fire, a visually entertaining experience. While the emphasis is definitely on outstanding sushi, don\u2018t stop there. Baked cauliflower florets, which are set against crispy puffed rice in a bowl, topped with basil and mint crisps and garnished with flowers, are truly a spectacle for all the senses. Add tuna tataki on beetroot tartare to that, and your gastronomic journey will be on the right track. The ramen looks like it came straight from a Japanese restaurant. A truly umami experience. If you\u2018re in the mood for something more substantial, try the pork ribs in Asian BBQ sauce, served on a perfect savory sweet potato croquette. This dish is served with a small meat cleaver, which you can easily use to cut the leaves of meat that practically melts in your mouth. If by some chance there is room left, be sure to round off the meal with an oat pie \u2013 Crack Pie, a symphony of sweet and salty, crunchy and creamy and buttery. The entire experience is rounded off by an impeccably professional and friendly staff who will be happy to advise and guide you through this Asian journey.",

From the first taste of a warm-up bites, such as finely chopped roast pork with avocado, radishes, and fresh herbs in a homemade tortilla whose gourmet aromas blend into a perfect unity or, on the other hand, crispy spring rolls with a rich filling of Mangalitsa prosciutto, cheddar cheese and asparagus, it is clear that pleasure is abundant here. They also serve their trademark dishes, such as the lightly stewed milky veal on polenta - the softness and the juiciness evoke the deepest enjoyment, or the excellent pork tam tam \u2013 a marbled piece of boned meat, bayadere style, with homemade puree, grilled spring onions and aromatic raspberry jam with a hint of truffle. For a sense of gastronomic art, you should try the seductive pistachio cake on white chocolate with raspberry gel and ice cream or, perhaps, the homemade apple pie with vanilla sauce.

Carts with hot, huge homemade bread that has just come out from under the sa\u010d, cut in front of guests, and waiters cleaning fish on carts or removing bones from delicious roast pork, contribute to the pleasant atmosphere and the feeling that every guest is important.

        "Review": "The keeper of traditional flavors with a touch of modernity, in a spacious and elegant environment in green and earthy tones, Bela reka guides every guest through the rich flavors offered by our country. As with any true host, this restaurant uses exclusively home- grown food, either from their farm in the Homolje mountains valley, famous for its Gramina cheeses, or from other reliable farmers. At the beginning, play with the senses with dishes saved from oblivion, such as cicvara, where the notes of cornmeal, cow\u2019s cheese, kajmak and butter flow into the harmony of flavors. A good combination is the calorie bomb, finely grilled pieces of steak in a crispy fried roll, topped with a gentle pumpkin seed sauce, to balance and raise the taste by an octave. When your expectations are at their peak, try an authentic symphony of softness, crispiness, sweet and salty sensations in masterfully prepared duck drumstick with homemade maple syrup. With a light pea and potato puree, every bite will bring you back to your childhood, to your grandmother\u2019s kitchen. And just like at grandma\u2019s, soft home-made vanilice or orasnice are waiting for you at the end. A careful selection of local wines and beers will contribute to an unforgettable taste. If you want to take home a piece of this magic, you can also do so if you visit the local delicatessen shop in the restaurant.",

Add to all this the excellent, handmade egg pasta served in various varieties and the excellent kumquat risotto that brings together several flavors and textures in a very daring way.

There is also a wide selection of wines by the glass, so don\u2019t hesitate to try a few types before choosing a bottle to accompany your meal. The extremely friendly and very well\u2013trained staff will be happy to discuss your wine preferences with you before helping you choose the right wine, but also the right dish that will go best with that wine. It is recommended to start with the classics. Foie gras and pineapple and chili chutney on brioche bread is a vivacious bite that plays with spicy and sweet, creamy, and crunchy, hot and cold. Steak tartare or prawn tartare are also good choices. Bao buns are a slightly more modern alternative, whether they are made with duck confit or pork, wittily named Vlach Magic, you won\u2019t go wrong. The menu is not extensive, but it is fun and substantial. There is a selection of steaks in which the parmesan and pistachio\u2013crusted steak stands out, as well as the aged rib eye.

Our recommendation is not to miss the steak tartare prepared with a special Latin twist. Namely, in addition to crushed Brazil nuts, marinated jalape\u00f1o peppers are added to the steak, which bring a special piquancy and freshness to this classic. An additional plus is that they combine it as a special show at your table. The interesting series continues with the specialties they named Suviche (a combination of Latin seviche and Asian sushi). Among the hot appetizers, Firework prawns in crispy tempura, which are then tucked in spicy mayonnaise, stand out. Whether you\u2019re into tacos or grilled meat, Toro won\u2019t let you down. For lovers of quality meat, Toro Steak, black angus tomahawk or dry aged rib eye are excellent choices. Don\u2019t skip the excellent roasted peppers that are additionally enriched with cashew aioli and sweetened with passion fruit glaze!

As with all success stories, the principles behind the concept are extremely simple \u2013 the redesign of Balkan cuisine, the use of ingredients specific to the climate and cooperation with local producers. With creative ideas and combinations, a new form of classics on a plate was created, and enjoyment is guaranteed. Important segments of this story are the ambience, which is simple, reduced, with a touch of minimalism but not cold, as well as the staff, who are extremely pleasant and friendly with their guests. Just reading the menu will delight you with the excellent combination of ingredients and you will have a serious dilemma about what to order, because you will want to try everything. It doesn\u2019t matter which of the great appetizers you choose, because enjoyment is guaranteed no matter what you decide on \u2013 crispy buckwheat flour rolls with young cheese, honey and caramelized walnuts, juicy pork leg croquettes with cream of fresh lemon and chives, Ljutenica, mustard greens and horseradish or maybe a mini\u2013bun with lamb, tomato salsa or olives and marinated cucumber. The impression is the same with the main specialties on the menu \u2013 pork on the side, juicy lamb, veal ribs with deep fried urnebes ball, and Istrian pasta with Mangalitsa lard and truffles. The end is sweetest with a chocolate cake with black truffle or a baked tart with prunes.",

        "Review": "In a small street food place in Zemun, a team of young, talented chefs shows their version of fast food. There are several types of burgers, from classics to Asian\u2013inspired ones. The umami burger made from slow\u2013roasted duck stands out. Then there are Thyme versions of falafel, beef kebabs and soft bao buns. They use fresh ingredients, and the menu follows the seasons and at the same time promotes local ingredients such as Karakachan lamb. The juicy and soft meat is wonderfully combined with young cabbage, mascarpone with bear\u2018s garlic and caramelized pistachios. Among the desserts, chocolate reforma parfait with hazelnut crunch and warm chocolate sauce and tart with seasonal ingredients stand out. The creative approach to street food makes this place special.",

        "Review": "The spirit of Latin American haciendas, with aged, first\u2013class cuts of meat and the exceptional way of their preparation, serving and presentation. All this was transferred to the business district of New Belgrade and makes the offer of the Rodizio restaurant. A luxurious and modernly equipped ambience, with ranch motifs, and wine and meat showcase, as well as friendly and well\u2013coordinated staff tell you that you are in for a treat right from the first impression. Make yourself comfortable and order some good red wine. It is recommended not to skip the one from South Africa, so the tasting can begin. You choose whether you will try meat aged for 25, 50 or 90 days, and whether you will choose t\u2013bone steak, tomahawk, porterhouse, or classic steak. For a dose of luxury, season the meat with gold flakes, and for a real rhapsody of taste, there is a jewel in the offer \u2013 picanha, the juiciest piece of marbled beef. If you have a voracious appetite and are ready for a meat earthquake, the specialty of the house \u2013 Rodizio grill or a selection of 11 different types of meat \u2013 is a must. Pleasure is not only for the palate but also for the eye, because Rodizio grill is served in a special way. Well-trained waiters, cortadores, use a large sword to chop pieces of meat in front of you and serve them in a well\u2013coordinated rhythm from several small portions, ensuring that each bite preserves the perfect juiciness and temperature. If all this was not sweet enough, at the end there is a premium cake or a portion of churros.",

        "Review": "The cute restaurant Osteria Mozzarela takes you on a gastronomic adventure with the most beautiful flavors of Italy begins with an unusual gourmet route along all the Italian regions. If we start from Piedmont, try the Italian French toast, or veal medallions, and have the cake with three types of milk for dessert. Lombardy will tempt you with the aromas of green risotto with turkey, or gnocchi with zucchini and salmon in the Italian way, and the sweet magic is in the authentic cheesecake. The sounds of the waves washing the coast are in the flavors of Liguria with the typical aromas of calamari in tomato sauce, or Livorno octopus. Magical Tuscany will bare its soul to us with pork neck on beans, veal tagliata or homemade profiteroles with chocolate. Of course, all roads lead to Rome and the Lazio region with classics, such as delicious soft-crispy turkey saltimbocca, turkey salad or prawns in white sauce. It wouldn\u2019t be Italy without Campania and its phenomenal selection of pizzas. Finally, you can sail to the romantic south, to Sicily and treat yourself to a traditional breakfast, mortadella-pistachio pizza, or Sicilian cannoli. And this is just a peek at discovering the regions of Italy and their characteristic flavors.",

There are also u\u0161tipci gratinated with roasted peppers and kajmak, traditional pljeskavica with onion and sausage with cheese. Furthermore - burritos with chicken or well- prepared grilled turkey with fine hazelnut sauce, tortilla rolls with spinach and spicy risotto, and we recommend that you try baked pasta. Choose the main ingredient - chicken, turkey or salmon, and enjoy. The portion is generous and tasty, and it is the right choice for a larger group. The main part of the menu includes rump steak with caramelized onions and feta cheese, pepper steak, and steak with enchilada. In the fish section, we recommend tuna and salmon steak, grilled squid, and sea bass with sauteed vegetables. Along with a large selection of pancakes, the absolute favorite among the delicacies is the unusual cake with an unusual name, Vatrena ljubav, with a perfect balance of textures, cream, and fruit.",

Even the lighter flavors carry notes of the unexpected, like the imaginative watermelon, goat cheese and pistachio salad. Or endive salad with caramelized seeds, hummus with red currants, and a tahini and soy dressing. And just when you think it can\u2019t get any better, you will be impressed once again, with a piece of rump steak aged for 60 days with a side dish of grilled Jerusalem artichoke, porcini mushrooms and hollandaise sauce. Finally, the sweets are the culmination of pleasure like baklava with pine nuts with the addition of candied orange sabayon and pear sorbet.

Before you dive into the vivid main courses, don\u2019t deny yourself one of the very special appetizers.

All those thoughts fall into oblivion after the first bite, as you indulge in pure pleasure. Whether you started with tuna crudo on spicy avocado puree, where the textures of avocado and tuna complement each other in a fun way, or with classic hummus additionally enriched with shiitake mushrooms and served with homemade pita bread, or you opt for a carefully selected selection of cheeses and dried meat products from Kosmaj, you can\u2019t go wrong. You can continue in the traditional manner \u2013 with excellent homemade sarma served on excellent potato puree, or \u0107evapi, and you can also switch to some of the specialties of world cuisine. Slow cooked veal cheeks will keep you coming back to this restaurant. Served on an exquisite saffron risotto, the cooked meat is in Port wine sauce, and enriched with goose p\u00e2t\u00e9, tomato jam and fresh truffles. Words can truly not describe how good it is.",

They also have a garden along the Sava River Promenade, and a view of the open kitchen. The attractive bistrot Balkanique concept is consistently implemented in the interior design, on the menu and on the plates. Although the location calls for it, Kolo is not only a place to take a break from shopping, but it is also inspiring enough to visit this particular restaurant. You can read on the paper coasters how the kolo dance was created, and what are the key details of Serbian folklore. The famous Pirot \u0111ubek is served in a pan, sprinkled with cracklings, and roasted hazelnuts, and we suggest as an ideal pair for this specialty veal rolls with roasted peppers, arugula, and cheese mousse, topped with spicy sauce. The main part brings the expected intense flavors, so we tried beef shin au gratin with soft dough crust with carrots, potatoes and kajmak, a dish for which you won\u2019t need a knife. The ubiquitous truffles appear here in the company of a pljeskavica on pita bread, with pickled onions and pickles that give a good balance to this unusual combination of flavors. They also offer Homolje lamb, game sausages, pork ribs and Mangalica neck. In the sweet part, Kolo skillfully expands and successfully plays beyond the limits, so both Paris brest and Pavlova served in a glass with lots of fruit left an excellent impression.",

Warm bites start with a somewhat surprising selection of homemade burek, but in a modern version \u2013 divided into segments with kajmak, Greek yogurt and cheese, followed by exotic shrimp and kumquat risotto, served with a side of celery, butter, zucchini and pumpkin oil. In the soup section, there is beef tea and Tuscan tomato soup. The main dish offer is the crown - such as Iberian pork steak with dark beer and a side of pie with aged cheese and potato cream or duck meat served in milk. The fish menu offers the flavors of juicy salmon in a crust or red mullet fillet with sweet corn puree. We also recommend the steaks. The coconut foam or Belgian garden with three types of chocolate and different textures are certainly a notable finale.",

        "Review": "The offer of the Campania Pizza Gourmet restaurant brings a touch of the Apennines and the rich gourmet flavors of Italy. As a contrast to the strict and cold business-residential complex in which it is located, the ambiance of the restaurant exudes warmth and the welcome you will experience from the first bites, and the flavors are more than great. Start your pleasure with baked crostini in several options - with tomatoes, stewed vegetables or nduja, a spicy sausage from Calabria. There are also classics like bocconcini with ricotta and zucchini, Sicilian rice balls with vegetables and mozzarella, arancini or caponata, stewed eggplant in extra virgin olive oil sauce. All the pasta comes from Gragnano, Campania region and it is bronze-die pasta. It\u2019s up to you to choose whether you want gnocchi with truffles, tagliatelle with several types of mushrooms, spaghetti alla putanesca or one of the pasta varieties. Save room for one of the main courses where you can expect refreshing chicken in lemon sauce, oven- braised beef meatballs with tomato sauce, salmon with vegetables baked in a wood-fired oven, or perhaps, 35\u201340-day aged beef steak. An excellent selection of Neapolitan pizzas prepared in a wood-fired oven is amazing. You won\u2019t be disappointed by the desserts either, so choose from the original tiramisu, caprese cake, panna cotta or lemon ice cream sorbet. With Aperol, grappa, or good wine, you will have a full gastronomic experience of Italy.",

From the must-have \u0107evapi according to the old recipe, which arrive in a soft bun, with the obligatory side dishes - creamy kajmak and onion. There is also dry aged T bone, beef carpaccio, and specialties such as beef diaphragm and bone stuffed with steak tartare are also featured on the menu. As a side dish, we recommend polenta or fries with truffles. Along with the great food, all the bites here are perfectly paired with the selected wines. A particularly cheerful atmosphere prevails at events, such as the Disco Market, which pleasantly complement and enhance the enjoyment of food and drink.",

        "Review": "Every plate in the Buena Vida gastrobar brings the vibrant temperament of Mexico. Located in the busy Navigator business district in New Belgrade, this restaurant with an equally lively atmosphere offers its guests a handful of good flavors and spicy notes. For starters, there are hand-made guacamole versions with marinated mango, goat cheese and basil, or avocado and pico de gallo sauce. The nachos mama with sofrito beans, roasted corn and crispy tortilla chips or the nachos loco with spicy toreado peppers and macha jalape\u00f1o salsa also go well with it. In the appetizer section, don\u2019t miss the toasted flatbread, coca, with steak carpaccio, fireworks sauce, rocket, mango, and salsa negra, or the empanadas \u2013 classic Mexican pies filled with marinated chicken filling with curry cream, salsa verdita, and cilantro. Another dish you must try is the tacos that come in a portion of three, and it\u2019s up to you to choose an option - Americano, crispy shrimp, or those with grilled chicken. For the main dish, there are juicy Mexican BBQ ribs with grilled pineapple salsa, ranchera steak served in a nice wok sauce with jasmine rice and French fries. If you want a unified impression, there is a menu option - Flavors of Mexico where you can experience the whole world of Mexican cuisine, a combination of a little bit of everything. The dessert will only complete the adventure, so be sure to try the traditional churros or the interesting Hit Me cake.",

        "Review": "The very name of the restaurant unequivocally hints at a sumptuous gastronomic pleasure. The authentic spirit and flavor of the Adriatic was brought and refined directly from Herceg Novi by dedicated owners who have been improving the quality of the offer for over two decades. The long wine list contributes to an exceptional experience, and the key role is played by the impressive offer of fresh fish and seafood. As an introduction to the magical world of the sea, try the aromatic sea fish p\u00e2t\u00e9 served with slices of butter and toasted bread, prawn tartar, crab cocktail or Njegu\u0161 prosciutto and cheese in oil. The stars of the local menu are sea bass, sea bream, sole, grouper tail, John Dory and red porgy - grilled, salted, or baked in the oven. The friendly staff will present you with the daily selection and advise you on the quantity. Perfectly grilled octopus is a powerful choice, and in combination with a mix of salads and potatoes, it gets a refreshing Mediterranean touch. Adriatic squid, grilled, fried, or stuffed, prawns on the grill, cooked (in buzara) or rolled with prosciutto, Saint Jacques scallops, or lobster, are some of the choices that you can\u2019t go wrong with in Gu\u0161ti. The excellent rich black risotto will impress you, and this section offers spaghetti and risotto with seafood, prawns, or shrimp. In the dessert section, you will find a delicious pie with sour cherries and ice cream, hazelnut parfait, tres leches cake and panna cotta.This is a place for a very special Adriatic pleasure.",
