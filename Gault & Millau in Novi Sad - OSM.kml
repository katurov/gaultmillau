In a beautiful location near the Danube and Novi Sad‘s favorite promenade Štrand, Cubo will accommodate you in their shady garden or pleasant interior. With a wine list that covers Serbian wine production, their menu invites you to stroll through a range of styles and tastes. The long selection of soups at the very beginning confirms this, with an intriguing combination of apples and walnuts in a celery potage, and a convincing consommé with ravioli. We recommend two mousses as an appetizer – blue cheese with fig jam, or chicken liver with Oxford sauce, and the delicious focaccia goes perfectly with both. This part of the menu also includes burrata with blood orange and deep-fried camembert with cranberries, tuna carpaccio and salmon with pomegranate caviar. Of the dozen types of pizza, Cubo with pork fillet, Rustic and Bolognese are intriguing, and an interesting offer of pasta and risottos. It is not easy to choose in the fish segment and meat specialties. From duck and chicken to cutlets and steaks. We made the right choice with the recommendation from the friendly staff: a touch of Asia with chicken drumsticks in honey, a return to home turf with beef cheeks, potato puree and mushroom ragu, to ribs in a spicy sauce with sauteed vegetables. Finally, with the waiter‘s strong recommendation, we chose rich Mozart balls in coffee sauce, and chocolate leaves filled with white chocolate and cashew cream with blueberry sorbet. In three words: pleasant, friendly, and delicious.

It all starts with a varied offer for breakfast, from classic to special options, with particularly imaginative sandwiches, continued with bruschetta, and followed by cream soups, and the cream soup with steak, spinach, and oyster mushrooms stands out as a novelty. Salads can be a nice introduction to a meal, like caprese served with focaccia, but also a stand–alone dish, like the salad with crispy squid, or a Chef salad with three types of meat. There really is something for everyone in the central part. There is a long list of pastas, risottos and pizzas, fish &amp; chips and perch fillets, as well as an impressive selection of chicken and turkey dishes, Zlatibor uštipci and gourmet pljeskavica, steaks and burgers.

A colorful and chaotic combination of ethnic motifs and colors, good home cooking and, sometimes, cheerful live music, topped with a huge dose of warm Vojvodina charm. That would be the brief description of Novi Sad restaurant Sokače. Whether in the warmer months you are planning a meal in the lovely patio or in the charming interior, be sure to make a reservation, especially on weekends, because the restaurant has long been a favorite place in Novi Sad.

The specialties of the house are mostly served for several people, whether it‘s pork or lamb leg, stuffed fillet rolled in bacon or pork ribs that are perfectly baked and then coated with a honey–based sauce.

Although there are a few meat dishes on the menu, such as turkey with mlinci, and rolled lamb on celeriac puree, the focus is on the flavors of the sea.

This section also includes hummus, zucchini croquettes, prawns in kadayıf, salmon and tuna carpaccio, crispy cheese rolls, and grilled cheese with seasonal fruit jam. Pasta and risotto are in a separate segment, and homemade tagliatelle with seafood is one of the richest we have tried on all coasts. Black and white risotto round off this segment of the menu. From the selection of fish, we chose tuna in red pepper, with an attractive presentation, as well as perch from Tisa. The well–written wine list is based on Serbia, the region, and Europe, with selected recommendations from the sommelier.

Certainly one of the more unusual places in the Novi Sad gastronomic scene is located in an unpretentious residential building. When you ring the bell on the seemingly ordinary door, you will step directly into the kitchen! Already at the door, you are greeted by Jasmina and her lovely and cheerful staff. They accommodate you carefully and at the same time offer an aperitif and then introduce you to the menu for the day. The menu changes frequently, once every two weeks, and each time is conceived as a gastronomic experience from several gangs. Along with the menus, they offer wine pairings that are carefully selected by local and regional winemakers. They sometimes also organize dinners with special wineries and then adjust their menus to the wine offer for that evening. Starting from the choice of plates, the selection and combination of ingredients, as well as the play of different textures, a thoughtful and special gastronomic experience awaits you. In our case, we were greeted by brie Bayadère sprinkled with salty and crunchy caramelized nuts and served with green apple and celery sorbet, which thoughtfully introduced freshness into every bite. Spinach semolina cake with almonds and sun–dried tomatoes served on buttermilk, which adds a creamy texture to every bite. Additional flavor is provided by strips of fermented red pepper covering the cake. The final dish was pork belly, well cooked and served with horseradish and rosemary cream with sauerkraut and fennel salad. The menus change often, but the effort and skill remain at the same level.

	<name>LE KLOK BISTRO</name>
	<description>Score: 13.5
Torques: 2

Le Klok has refreshed Novi Sad‘s offer with an authentic bistro concept that focuses on basic French cuisine with the occasional excursion into Italian ideas, but the real question is – how? The feeling we got is – very personal, and with a great passion for food, and for quality ingredients, following their origin as well as the idea – we do it ourselves. Homemade bread in their version is an excellent start with quality olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It‘s always good to start with a dip! They obviously pay a lot of attention to the dishes they prepare, both in their development and in their conceiving and preparation. With each dish, you will hear a short narrative explaining why what you are eating is special, and how much effort was put into it to get to the plate. Such stories are always useful, because they round off nicely the experience, and they direct the guest‘s attention to the food. Onion soup served French style with melting baked cheese, this time it was combined with blue cheese and cognac. There is also a twice– baked cheese souffle that captivates with French decadence and is extremely elegant in taste. The menu includes a wide range of meat and fish specialties. With a good wine list, a nice selection of wines by the glass, a pleasant atmosphere, and exceptional service, Le Klok has fully justified its attraction to the public.

	<name>COMIDA SANCHEZ</name>
	<description>Comida Sanchez has won the hearts of Mexican street food lovers. The place is of the hole-in-the-wall type and reminds of some of the best experiences we‘ve had with this type of street food. Long cooking and marinating, lots of fresh herbs, homemade tortillas and accompanying sauces come together effectively in a menu that you will enjoy. There are, for us, favorites, birria tacos with slow-cooked beef, grilled with cheese, as well as versions with pork and chicken. Chimichangas, quesadillas, Brazilian meatballs paired with a dozen homemade salsas will delight any foodie. For a sweet ending, there‘s Peruvian citrus cake or tortilla chips with Mexican cherry sauce.

	<name>THE CAMELOT - GASTRO PUB</name>
	<description>The Camelot gastro–bar exudes a relaxed atmosphere but takes its food and home–made craft beer seriously. The interior is inspired by knights and the legends of Camelot, from wooden tables to plates shaped like knights‘ shields. The menu is dominated by excellent meat, but pasta and salad meals are also on offer. In the first part of the day, fried pancakes, a meal of salads, sandwiches and eggs are popular, and lunch is a real knightly celebration. Ribs in beer covered with honey and served with homemade potatoes and sauerkraut are the star of the menu. Pork medallions in sour cherry or mushroom sauce, pork shins and chicken in various variations satisfy the diverse tastes of guests. Pancakes with coffee are a nice, sweet ending to this pleasant gastronomic journey.

	<name>KORPA DELI MARKET I BISTRO</name>
	<description>Score: 12
Torques: 1

A modern restaurant focused on meat specialties and next to a well- supplied delicatessen store. The wine list is short, but wines from the store are available with a service charge. The menu opens with a selection of hand–sliced delicacies, followed by dry age tartare, tataki, carpaccio, and burrata. An interesting selection of appetizers follows, we chose rolls filled with pork ham, beets with young cheese, apple gel and sprinkled with hazelnuts. The pasta and risotto section varies familiar themes, and the simple spaghetti aglio e olio was tasty and spicy. In the meat section, they have turkey with mlinci, duck breast and veal fillet in cognac and pine nut sauce, and for serious gourmets, we recommend the burger for two with kajmak from Stara Planina and pickled onions. There are also burgers, and a powerful selection of Serbian dry aged meats. For those who prefer fish, the choice is tuna, sea bass, sea bream and salmon fillets, as well as grilled squid. From the Deli menu section, we recommend the juicy and tender rolled rib, served on pumpkin puree with homemade demiglace sauce and parsnip chips, as well as the boldly spiced kebab, served with seriously spicy peppers and sour cream with mint, on homemade pita bread. Floating island with almond flakes, delicious warm cake with poppy seeds in white chocolate sauce, along with baklava with pistachios, seasonal crumble, and chocolate souffle will sweetly round off your stay.

Torques: 2

With its nautical design and original name, this restaurant takes you from the former Pannonian Sea to the shores of the Mediterranean with exciting tastes from the sea, with a few excursions to the land. We recommend white cod spread on bruschetta, with a few drops of olive oil, followed by a clear sea soup. Njeguš prosciutto is sliced in the middle of the tavern, there is Slavonian kulen and grilled goat cheese, and scallops and anchovies from the sea. The friendly staff will recommend the best of the offer and expertly clean and fillet the fish in front of you. The wine list, with a large selection of wines by the glass, provides an adequate accompaniment to local delicacies. Expertly prepared and perfectly tasty octopus and prawns are prepared on the grill. Among the fish on offer, turbot with a delicately sweet taste stands out, followed by sea bream and sea bass, common dentex, and John Dory, and along with them, brodetto for two, Patagonian squid, and tuna steak. The mighty, creamy, sumptuous, and brilliant, black risotto deserves special praise, and the risotto with cold tuna tartare and polenta with truffles in a crispy parmesan basket invites further exploration of this part of the menu. A selection of aged meat arrives from the mainland, including tender dry aged ram steak, and surf &amp; turf steak with prawns, while the house specialty cake brings a fine symphony of chocolate aromas. A very tasty and very appealing piece of sea in the plain of Vojvodina.
