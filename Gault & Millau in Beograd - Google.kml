	<description>The famous corner of Vračar remembers many iconic catering names of the Belgrade scene and several creative culinary approaches. The interior subtly blends different styles, from classic to modern, making you feel cozy and comfortable just like in a Parisian bistro. The menu is brief and carefully designed to take you on an exciting journey that boldly mixes gastro styles and influences. Start with onion soup. With a bit of cognac and a fine balance of intense aromas of cheese and onion, it is the right way to open the door to the local gastronomic world. Tartare or carpaccio can be the next step, and from the hot appetizers section we recommend the attractive tonkatsu - a great wok fillet prepared with spinach and mushrooms. On a similar note in the main menu, the Japanese calamari with nishiki rice and seasonal vegetables from the wok was excellent. The classic lasagna was excellent, and the chicken tikka took us to another part of Asia, with an equally effective balance of flavors. The selection of steaks and Adriatic fish is a special part of the offer. Recommended dishes are the Irish ale pie, and the Cafe de Paris slice. The staff is discreet and confident in every recommendation. In the sweet section, they are proud of the floating island according to a recipe from 1953, while the warm date cake deserves more than a warm recommendation. A restaurant that will seduce you with its special charm both in the atmosphere and ambience, both on your plate and in your glass.</description>

	<name>SALAŠ VINARIJE ZVONKO BOGDAN BEOGRAD</name>
	<description>The Zvonko Bogdan Winery Salaš in Belgrade, located at the very beginning of Beton hala, was designed after the original farmhouse located in the north of Serbia near the Palić Lake. The idea was to bring to the capital the special feelings of enjoying good home– cooked food, wine and an atmosphere filled with the pleasant sounds of tamburica. We can gladly say that they have succeeded. Salaš pays due attention to the food, both by nurturing their verified long–term suppliers and in preparing the ingredients that are combined into some of the most famous Vojvodina specialties. Most of the well– known specialties from the original Salaš are in the menu, and some new ones were specially prepared for Belgrade guests. Vojvodina’s hot gibanica is one of the best cheese pies we’ve ever enjoyed. You will also enjoy the perfectly executed deep–fried peppers stuffed with cheese and gourmet delights such as marinated smoked veal tongue on a tortilla base, and celery salad with eggs. Don’t miss the carrot soup with semolina dumplings! Moving on to the main dishes, we suggest the duck under the sač served on mlinci, or some of the gourmet dishes such as lamb shanks, or spicy pork hooves. Don’t forget that you are at Salaš, a place to relax, the evenings are a real pleasure with the sounds of tamburica from Vojvodina and selected live music.</description>

The exceptional ambience is harmoniously complemented by cuisine based on quality ingredients and enhanced by creative interplay through a meaningful and harmonious crossing of tastes. An impressive wine list with almost three hundred labels from all the meridians confirms hedonistic orientation. When you add perfect service, staff that discreetly combines experience and youth, all you need to do is to let go. The coconut–prawn soup is an absolute recommendation, and the subtle salad of baby spinach, peaches, beets, and crushed hazelnuts with young goat cheese mousse is one of the favorites on the menu. Tender prawn tartare with avocado and eel sauce continues this streak, and there are also veal fillet tartare and beef cheeks with parsnip puree and white chocolate. The part with pastas and risotto is short and intriguing, such as lavish ravioli with duck and foie gras, and creamy risotto with sea bass. In the meat section, the Toro ribs were excellent as one of the novelties on offer, and on the main stage, look into seafood delicacies, as well as the steaks from Golija beef, and the Mangalica cutlet. The sweet part is an equally stunning addition. Suggestive chocolate Nemesis, gentle semifreddo, New York style cheesecake, and striking lemon tart make the choice sweet and painful. This is truly a special restaurant.</description>

The first of the seven famous courses is white corn mush with fried ajvar from Leskovac peppers. It is followed by a reinterpretation of homemade brioche popara with a crunchy uštipak, stew with quail meat and pumpkin panna cotta, and then an imaginative representation in the form of beans with matured kulen espuma and veal sauce. Traditional sarma is transformed to sauerkraut jelly and yoghurt ice cream with an old type of cereal. This is followed by an effective minimalist beef rib eye, with aged garlic and potatoes.

	<name>ENDORFIN</name>
	<description>Defined as a place for local &amp; craft food, Endorfin confidently and skillfully crosses local ingredients and a modern culinary approach. The sidewalk garden is part of the Dorćol chic, while the interior is modernly elegant. The menu opens with small bites, suitable both as an option for larger groups and as an opportunity to try more interesting combinations. We chose a playful palette of flavors – smoked eggplant and caramelized mushrooms on toast, duck confit croquettes with creme fraiche, excellent gravlax salmon on sourdough blinis with pickled onions and roast beef on toast with arugula, and horseradish mousse. Lamb bayadere and Serbian burrata, grilled goat cheese on burek crust, veal tartar with mint, and roasted pepper puree are also part of this introductory magic. Soup with buckwheat noodles and coriander is plentiful and hearty, and in the main part, don’t miss the famous roasted kale with red cabbage puree, which Endorfin was the first to introduce in Belgrade. We also recommend fresh tagliatelle with Mangalica bacon and asparagus. Homemade gnocchi with sage and butter, risotto with Fruška gora mushrooms, chicken drumstick in prokupac sauce, and duck breast with orange cream and beetroot are also attractive. Seasonal tiramisu with raspberries and home–made ladyfingers, and a powerful dark chocolate and hazelnut cake served with vanilla ice cream round off the pleasant atmosphere. Endorphin is undoubtedly a true representative of gastro–style bistronomy.</description>

	<name>FRANZ BY TT</name>
	<description>Franz by TT is one of a series of lifestyle projects that have sprung up in Belgrade recently. At the core of the concept is a relaxed bistro style for the young and, of course, for those who feel that way. The menu is refreshingly different from what we are used to in Belgrade, and the food is excellent, aesthetically pleasing and, on top of that, unpretentious. The attractive cocktail menu includes interesting combinations of well-known flavors, as well as some non-alcoholic mixes such as lemonade with raspberry and sage, or apricot and almonds. All parts of the menu and beverage menu are very concise and seem to hit the mark. There is a quality breakfast based on pancakes, waffles, but also Shakshouka with spinach leaves, and from the meze selection we recommend fried brie cheese with berry sauce, as well as the Olivier salad. Of the main dishes, you will enjoy wonderfully spicy pasta with prawns, lime and mint, good homemade beef goulash stewed in beer and served on mashed potatoes. We also recommend salmon steak with fennel on orange puree. The selection of wines is very interesting, but also extremely limited. It is worth mentioning that all wines are also available by the glass.</description>

	<name>THE SQUARE</name>
	<description>Since its opening, the Square Nine hotel and its restaurants have raised the bar in every hospitality segment. A visit to The Square restaurant is a hedonistic feast in every detail, sip, and bite. David Šimunić, the new chef, presented an imaginative author’s menu based on local heritage excitingly crossed with modern trends. Greetings from the kitchen come as a cute scone with crackers and cream, and a delicious scone with butter. The Olivier salad arrives in its deconstructed version, consisting of bars and purees of basic ingredients such as carrots and peas. Next is a great kavurma with brioche, dried apricots, and a kajmak–based dressing, accompanied by a lucid savoury shiso leaf in tempura. The questioning of tradition continues through two magical versions of burek – with cow’s cheese and kajmak, and with Buša meat, foie gras and grated truffles. All this, and more, is part of the unique Experience menu. On the regular menu are Square classics, ranging from Bolognese to steak tartare to burgers. The gastronomic journey through the landscapes of the modernized and shifted Balkan cuisine continues with perfect lamb meat served in a rich sauce based on white chocolate, apple, pear and tonka beans, effectively accompanied by a roll on sauerkraut. Gin and pear sorbet will prepare your palate for the sweet part with a famous selection of European stars. Mille feulle, and especially Pain perdu get only flattering marks for the magical mix of aromas and textures.</description>

	<description>Everything is said when you say Franš. An indispensable name on the gastronomic map of the capital is remembered for the harmoniously arranged garden, interesting quotes and wine showcases in the interior, as well as for the well-coordinated team of discreet and cordial waiters. Franš is a frequent choice for celebrations, so be sure to make a reservation, regardless of the time of day or year. The extensive menu skillfully and harmoniously combines national and international, traditional, and contemporary, in dishes that adhere to high standards in every respect. A selection of local delicacies is a logical choice to start with, as well as very nice homemade pies. As soon as you settle down, a selection of hot pastries and an interesting couvert arrives on the table, which includes a serious selection of olive oils and spices. Ask what seasonal potages they have, and an unusual mix of celery, beetroot and prunes was excellent. Furthermore, listen to the recommendations of the friendly waiters. In addition to the rich meat menu, on which we highlight the juicy Franš packages, there is also an excellent selection of fish, while generous and creamy pastas are especially highlighted. One section is dedicated to truffle dishes, and there is also a lean, vegetarian section. The list of desserts is separated in the electronic edition of the menu and offers an irresistible choice - from tulumba filled with vanilla ice cream, over sumptuous cakes like Remy Martin or cake with fresh raspberries, tiramisu, and crème brulee, to a great trilogy of chocolate mousses and pancakes in multiple versions. It is the right choice for many people and is the first choice for all occasions.</description>

A wide selection of wine labels, which are available in an impressive number by the glass, cocktails, domestic and international spirits, as well as excellent mixes of squeezed juices, will be pleasant if you stop by for a break after a walk or bike ride. If you are in the mood for a light lunch, there is a wide selection of sushi rolls, salads and sandwiches. Thinly sliced tender pieces of steak in a crispy crust, topped with a simple, delicious pumpkin seed sauce, make an excellent warm appetizer. Chicken pate and Lyon quenelle are highly recommended. For lovers of the classics with a little twist, there is also sweet foie gras with strawberry jam. Then a series of pastas starts, among which we would single out osso bucco Bolognese, an interesting innovation of the classic, and spaghetti served with slow–cooked beef shank and bone marrow in a creamy red sauce. For gourmets, there is the must–have pulled pork, shank with mlinci, burgers and veal in kajmak sauce, which is truly the trademark of this restaurant. In addition to sushi, fish specialties include salmon, tuna and perch. For dessert, we tried an excellent cake made of four types of Belgian chocolate, with a creative name – 4d cake!</description>

	<name>LANGOUSTE</name>
	<description>There is a long list of adjectives that can be used to describe the unique gastronomic experience at the Langouste restaurant, which has become a modern fine dining restaurant where the local and the global are boldly questioned and crossed. A luxurious wine list and a list of premium alcoholic beverages harmoniously accompany the unique culinary creations. We recommend one of the tasting menus - meat, fish or a menu that combines the best of both selections, and there is also an À la carte selection. From greetings from the kitchen, through exceptional sourdough bread, to dessert, each plate is a small work of art, precisely executed, visually effective, and sensational on the palate. The magic starts with homemade pastries with truffle- flavored butter, followed by crust cones with shiitake mushroom and Parmesan filling, mushroom cream and beer hop foam creatively served in an eggshell. The rhapsody of flavors continues with tender, seasonal potages, and powerful pheasant consommé with floating chicken liver pâté. Then, on the one hand, a subtle smoked greater amberjack tartare served on a refreshing cucumber and celery jelly, and on the other, an intense crispy pie with truffles and Pirot cheese. The feast of gastronomy continues with desserts. Green tea frothy cream with crumbled fermented fig leaf and coconut ice cream are there to coat the palate, and then they are won over by Paris–Brest with hazelnut cream and ice cream from caramelized kajmak.Exceptional!</description>

	<name>BARREL HOUSE</name>
	<description>Barrel House, a space with a modern minimalist design, often hosts various events, so be sure to check availability. In the evenings, the experience is rounded off by live music, and their inspiring menu provides enough reasons to explore and pair tastes, starting from creative cocktails to predominantly Serbian wines on the wine list. Warming up comes with sharing plates, walnuts that give a seductive note to rolled plums, and apricots paired with pistachios, while magical nuances are introduced by the famous gyoza. As a starter, salmon is served in gravlax or tartar option, there is also baked burrata and falafel, black risotto, and gnocchi with Mangalica meat. Modern national grilled meat is represented by pljeskavica with Miroč cheese, and on the other hand, baked tripe, goulash with gnocchi and kajmak, and veal head in tripes, baked with Parmesan cheese. We tried an interesting dish, liver stuffed with red onion jam, prunes, and hazelnuts, on carrot and apple puree and mighty aged roast beef in an intense sauce with four types of peppercorns. Flambéed beef neck, rolled duck, rolled sea bass, pork belly, and pig cheeks sous vide, are equally captivating with their modern execution and presentation, and the friendly staff knows what to recommend. Finally, the deconstructed Vanilla slice with raspberry liqueur reduction, served in a wine glass, along with baked delicate lime cheesecake, topped with homemade blueberry jam, are just a confirmation of the playfulness in every segment of the menu, the beverage menu, and the entire concept.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN PAVILION</name>
	<description>One of the more interesting boutique hotels in the heart of Belgrade can boast a restaurant with a modern and urban concept as part of its offer. During the day, the atmosphere is intended for city meetings, business lunches or moments when you just want to enjoy the peace, and the evenings are dedicated to good times, nights out to be pampered by the professional staff of the bar with an excellent offer of cocktails, and music for a good atmosphere. Although the kitchen is oriented towards a quality bistro offer in terms of ingredients, preparation techniques, gentle fusion of elements of world cuisines as well as presentation, it remains simplified enough to nicely round off the needs of the hotel as well as the concept of the restaurant itself. Everything we tried was extremely tasty, beautifully presented and served with a smile. An excellent wine list as well as the bar offer are one of Pavillion’s strengths. On the menu, in addition to several excellent vegetarian and vegan options, you will find most of the specialties from the bistronomic all stars team - duck fillet, lamb shank, beef cheeks or osso bucco, which we welcome as gourmets and lovers of this selection. It seems that there is a growing trend of using demiglace in more places on the menu, which we noticed here as well. In the announcement of the new menu, they have the opportunity to surprise the guests with a new interesting sauce.</description>

	<description>This Casa Nova restaurant in Dorćol tempts with a seductive combination of Italian and French cuisine. As soon as you step into the romantic ambiance of the restaurant with many hidden corners,you will be greeted by friendly staff who are here to fulfill your wishes. The menu itself is structured in two sections. The first section is simply called Light, and here you will find a variety of appetizers such as juicy parmigiana di melanzane or rolled mozzarella with pesto sauce, and you will also find the soups you shouldn’t skip, such as the tomato soup with pistachios or stracciatella, or clear chicken soup with dumplings made of Parmesan and parsley. Light bites also include selected fish, like fresh salmon with asparagus or smoked trout, a salad meal or salad with a meal.

The second section is called Fine Menu, and it offers various meat options. We recommend duck in berry sauce or turkey in gorgonzola sauce. The steaks are simply an explosion of taste in this menu section. Whether it‘s a steak served on arugula, with porcini mushrooms or in a spicy cognac and pine nut sauce, green pepper or maybe red wine and raisins, you should try one. Round off your experience with a lemon tart or a chocolate mousse. From the good selection of wines by the glass, choose one to pair with the dessert as well.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN VUK</name>
	<description>If a restaurant has guests who have been coming regularly for decades through several generations, from visits with their parents when they were children to coming with their children or grandchildren, that venue is my definition of a seriously iconic restaurant. Vuk certainly is, and today it is a favorite place for dining, conversations, and business meetings for a wide variety of audiences. In accordance with its slogan, “If you haven’t been to Vuk, then you haven’t been to Belgrade”, it is still a place visited by many tourists and visitors passing through Belgrade. This is partly due to the excellent location in the downtown pedestrian area, with two beautiful patios on two streets, and partly to the sense of history and tradition that lives in every plate served. Their classics, such as veal schnitzel, veal pilaf, stuffed peppers, or garden patience rolls, are made lavishly, honestly and from high quality ingredients, and above all, standardized by vast experience. The old, experienced waiters will pamper you with the top service that you expect in this type of restaurant and that many of us love and appreciate. Don’t forget to enjoy the people sitting next to you because it seems like every table has its own story to tell, and at the same time it’s as if they are all united by a secret. I guess that’s the secret of such places with a special character.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN PAŠA</name>
	<description>Located on Zemun quay, Paša is one of those restaurants where everything is good. The view of the wide Danube is priceless, regardless of whether you are sitting on the terrace or in the cozy interior. Everything on the small, but obviously carefully designed menu is delicious– both river and sea fish, as well as meat specialties and everything from the grill. The first dish is the inevitable spicy and rich fish broth, followed immediately by bruschetta with rolled goat cheese or with vegetables in a pesto dressing. Turkey with mlinci is the highlight of the offer, just note that it arrives in a portion for two, and it is enough for three or four hungry persons. It takes a while to prepare, but it is worth the wait. On the meat side of the menu, there is excellent barbecue, and our favorite is Deda Ćira’s pljeskavica, followed by homemade sausages and pork fillet in a bacon crust, but also T–bone steak, filet mignon, and beef chop. If you want seafood flavors on the river, Paša Plata is an excellent choice, with a mix of grilled octopus legs, mussels, shrimp and squid, and seafood risotto served in the middle of the table. The Danube story is presented by the Paša plate on which perch, carp and trout are served. You can order each one of these as a separate dish, and we draw your attention to trout fillets in caper and almond sauce, or sea bream in lime and dill sauce. Finally, the apple cake is a must.</description>

	<name>BURGER HOUSE BROS</name>
	<description>The story of the brothers who brought the taste of burgers from America continues to develop. The core of the gastronomic experience is the beef, which is roasted so that the center is juicy and full of flavor. From the standard burger with cheddar cheese, to the local burger with Serbian Miroč cheese, perfect for grilling, there is also the Double smash burger and the youngest, decadent Truffle Bro with truffle. It has truffle and hazelnut oil, truffle carpaccio, plus truffle sauce. If you want to step out of the burger section, we recommend the crispy chicken, or the veggie cheeseburger. Homemade or sweet potatoes, crispy onion rings or fried mozzarella are the perfect accompaniment.</description>

	<name>STARA HERCEGOVINA</name>
	<description>The specialty of this favorite restaurant is traditional dishes. For starters, cold and hot appetizers such as peppers stuffed with cheese, prebranac, corn bread or pihtije and breaded tripes, dishes that always raise long discussions. Cheese and prosciutto go perfectly with homemade rakija as appetizers. A rich selection of cooked dishes preserves the spirit of the kafana specialties – from juicy ham hock, long cooked sauerkraut, veal head in tripes, to tripes in sauce. There are also great dishes from the grill, Leskovac stew, grilled veal brisket, sausages, pljeskavica, and ćevapčići. The sweet end of the meal is also rooted in tradition, so in Old Herzegovina the meal ends with tufahija, urmašica or plum pie.</description>

	<name>LORENZO &amp; KAKALAMBA</name>
	<description>Lorenzo i Kakalamba is a very special sensory experience indeed. From the entrance you encounter a visual cacophony of interesting furniture together with motifs of Pirot rugs appear in combination with a life-size Terminator sculpture. It sounds crazy, but it actually works! The very concept of the restaurant is based on a combination of Italian and local cuisine, with a special focus on Pirot specialties. Although the menu puts an emphasis on meat, from Pirotski Žešći Lučić to a selections of aged steaks, do not miss the opportunity to try the excellent marinated salmon carpaccio. This is a refreshing prelude and a perfect combination of delicate pieces of marinated salmon and crunchy fresh cucumbers with pine nuts that add another dimension to the texture of the dish. If you are looking for a lighter dinner, try the handmade ravioli filled with pistachio cream and pecorino cheese. The combination of pasta, filling and creamy sauce will gently hug and comfort you. Duck fillet and chicken fillet stuffed with truffle mousse are a treat in themselves. Complete the pleasure with a selection of Serbian and Italian wines, and when you are ready for dessert, the waiters will show you a huge board with pictures of desserts. The chocolate sphere is visually attractive, but the real gem among the sweets is the seemingly simple Tres leches prepared to take you back to your childhood and add another layer of taste. Dinner and a show – that’s what they would call it in Hollywood.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN RUBIN</name>
	<description>Surrounded by the greenery of Košutnjak, with a spectacular view of the city, Rubin defines itself as a place of fine local cuisine, a long tradition and an enviable reputation. An elegant interior, discreet and more than pleasant service, a respectable wine list and a great selection of premium drinks make Rubin a unique place, special in every detail. In the summer season, especially on weekends, you need to make a reservation for a table in the garden. On Fridays and weekends they have live jazz music, so we advise you plan enoughtime and not rush anywhere. An absolute recommendation for starters is the steak tartare. In the introductory part, there is also a selection of meat and dairy delicacies, interesting baked kale, deep–fried celery and porcini stew. Glazed cheeks are rightfully one of the specialties of the main menu. They are perfectly tender and served on celery puree. We also recommend the crispy Mangulica bayadere on pea puree, with pickled onions. Zürich–style medallions are another favorite, and in addition to national grilled specialties, there are also tripes, mućkalica, roast veal and cutlet, duck fillet with sweet potato and drumstick in port wine sauce. The tray with sweets is brought out at the end of the meal, it will not be easy to decide between the Raffaello cake, the chocolate sphere or the raspberry gratin, while the Paris– Brest and the interesting, sweet mix in a jar left a great impression like everything we have tasted here.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN RUZMARIN</name>
	<description>You will find a true oasis of Mediterranean cuisine in the Ruzmarin restaurant, located near the Central Garden residential complex. The menu puts an emphasis is on Greek and Italian cuisine. With a refined, bright interior with lots of glass surfaces, Ruzmarin is an excellent choice for short business lunches, as well as for longer food enjoyment. At the start, don‘t miss the homemade breads, but be careful – it‘s easy to start with them, but it‘s hard to stop. The menu also includes a slightly different chef‘s steak tartare, well done and interesting, grilled cheese from the mountain Rtanj as a combination of local ingredients and a Mediterranean approach to cheese, as well as Italian bruschetta and Greek grapevine leaf rolls. For those who go in the direction of a lighter meal, a meal salad is the usual choice on the menu. There are interesting combinations in the risotto and pasta section, and we recommend the gnocchi with turkey and baby spinach. Here you will eat good Mediterranean squid prepared with an interesting combination of potatoes and spinach, but also slow–cooked lamb shank, so tender that it will melt in your mouth. They also have a good selection of steaks, and Italian specialties, such as saltimbocca. A special offer is a Spanish suckling pig, which according to the Spanish tradition is cut with a plate, but to enjoy this delicacy you need to make an appointment the day before.</description>

	<name>BISTRO MALI PIJAC</name>
	<description>Mali pijac is situated in a house that is a cultural monument. It boldly combines the styles and techniques of French and Serbian cuisine in the manner of a modern Parisian bistro. Hearty onion soup that you simply cannot skip and real homemade beef soup with dumplings will warm you up. In the introductory part of the recommendations are lucid beef tongue carpaccio with pickled red onion, slaw, and berry vinegar, as well as chicken liver pâté with blackberry jam and onion butter. Pâté is served with magical homemade sourdough bread. Relying on the local and seasonal is one of the hallmarks of the kitchen, so we tried the perfect asparagus risotto, and even better kale in sauerkraut sauce on purple sweet potato puree. The menu also includes delicious potatoes with young kajmak and chive oil, pasta with truffles, and duck on apple and orange puree, while the Mali Pijac pljeskavica, Mangalica fillet and veal sweetbread in demiglace sauce are a nice tribute to the local cuisine. Everything is accompanied by a well–designed wine list with Serbian and French labels, as well as a long list of cocktails. An impressive presentation and a fine harmony of flavors raise the experience to a higher level, and it is rounded off by the indispensable Crêpes Suzette, as well as the baklava with pistachios, which they are proud of, served with milk ice cream. Precise execution, charming approach both in the kitchen, as well as in the ambience and service make this place one of the favorites.</description>

	<name>MEZESTORAN DVORIŠTE</name>
	<description>Although it is located in the very center of the city, one of the most beautiful gardens in Belgrade is well hidden and tucked away. Mezestoran Dvorište, as its name suggests, relies on an extremely rich menu full of different mezzes that become a rich gastronomic experience when combined with a good selection of domestic wines available by the glass. The menu is made up of an interesting combination of different Mediterranean cuisines, a few local specialties, with a hint of Turkish cuisine specialties. We recommend you try beets with walnuts in a mild yogurt and lime sauce. The extremely simple, but perfectly harmonious, dish will refresh you and prepare you for everything that follows. Lahmacun, a dish with lamb, rich in herb and spice aromas of the Middle East, is another must.Bavette Mare Monte, a dish with fresh mussels, prawns, courgettes and cherry tomatoes, is an impressive gastronomic and visual experience. And the Izmir kebab, juicy and tender meat, perfectly seasoned and served with a refreshing combination of tomatoes, onions, and yogurt on a crusty pita bread. As a slightly gentler option, they have salmon fillet served with bulgur, almonds, and vegetables, with an extremely creamy, almost silky orange, lemon and ginger sauce that gives the fillet a breath of freshness. If there is room left for dessert, we recommend the vanilla slice, big, deliberately chaotic, a bit messy, visually noisy, and fundamentally excellent.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN OPERA</name>
	<description>Tucked away in one of the busiest pedestrian areas of the city center, the Opera restaurant modestly opens its doors and welcomes everyone who has the desire to experience the delicious notes of its offer. In an elegant classic interior, or in a very pleasant summer garden, the restaurant offers the same atmosphere to its guests all year round. The menu is designed in a way that it takes the best of local cuisine, combining it with selected classics of the world gourmet scene. The diverse selection opens with appetizers such as juicy steak carpaccio served with a fresh dressing of basil, rocket, Parmesan, and crunchy roasted almonds. In a trio of mushrooms, the aromas of porcini mushrooms, button mushrooms and oyster mushrooms alternate one after the other, and the menu also includes several creamy risottos. For the next bite, choose one of the refreshing salad meals, such as the one that combines figs in red wine, iceberg, and goat cheese, or one with homemade pasta. In the main specialties section, gourmet bites await you, such as pork medallions blended gently with prune sauce or Mediterranean turkey in an interesting combination with pumpkin seed dressing. Salmon La bohème offers slightly lighter and equally exotic flavors with a whirlwind of mango, prosciutto, cucumber, and paprika. The note of enjoyment will be completed by some of the desserts, such as the classic or summer version of Opera cake or, perhaps, cooked wheat with ground hazelnuts.</description>

A true hybrid of cafe and restaurant, this place with a fantastic garden has an extremely rich drink menu with wine labels from various geographical regions, as well as a mixed and rich selection of spirits and cocktails. There is also an enviable selection of nonalcoholic drinks, pressed juices, and premium coffees. The cooks place a serious emphasis on the brunch option. Breakfast is represented by eggs Benedict, omelets, and scrambled eggs. This is followed by a variety of oatmeal and sandwiches, and the Tuna Melt is truly special for all the senses. The series continues with a delicate dinner salad, and we warmly recommend the Thai Shrimp. If you‘re in the mood for a bite to eat while sipping fantastic cocktails, there‘s an exceptional selection of perfectly balanced pizzas. Sheher pizza with parmesan cream and smoked rump steak is praiseworthy. There are also exceptional pastas, such as excellent gnocchi in truffle sauce, which you can enhance with pieces of steak. Madre mio, Premium Salmon and Teriyaki Glazed Tuna are the absolute stars of the kitchen and it‘s really hard to choose a favorite. Be sure to leave room for dessert and try classics like Apple Crumble or Tiramisu, but also a very gentle and refreshing Kiss based on mascarpone cheese with Nutella and seasonal fruit.</description>

As in any serious restaurant, people come to Šaran for several reasons, the main one of which is certainly the top-quality offer of fresh river and sea fish, and seafood. Although restaurants of this type opt for very simple preparation, because the emphasis is on the quality of the food, here on the menu you will find specialties such as Vojvodina style perch fillets - baked in pasta, with smoked cheese and poppy seeds, or interesting combinations such as top-quality tagliatelle with vongole, porcini mushrooms, shrimp, and tomato jam. There is no need to emphasize that the daily offer of fresh sea and river fish is wide. Other, no less important reasons that make Šaran a superior gastronomic destination are certainly the beautiful atmosphere of the old Zemun house, decorated with taste and warmth, and an excellent offer on the wine list, followed by good recommendations from extremely friendly and professional staff.

	<description>This place is special in that you won’t go wrong whether you’re in the mood for a cocktail, sushi, or a specialty from the Far East. Sakura is modern space with Asian details, and it has a menu made up of a wide variety of cuisines from the Far East. They emphasize visual presentation - expect every dish to be extremely Instagrammable! Yes, sushi is the expected choice, but specialties that will stay in your memory for much longer are also on the menu. For example, Korean Kimchi Tuna, which is most reminiscent of tuna tartare, additionally raised with kimchi and crunchy pieces of vegetables that build on the creamy structure of the tuna and bring a special sour–spicy pleasure in every bite. Sprouts and broccoli will intrigue you, as well as Nasi Goreng, Pad Thai, or tempura specialties. Saint Jacques and grilled vegetables in sweet Sakura sauce and Hoisin Salmon are a real treat for seafood lovers. Stir fry duck with dried chilies and Szechuan pepper brings waves of pleasant spiciness, but also the specific taste of Szechuan, a truly special bite for gourmets. If you like Asian classics, there is Bulgogi or sweet and sour pork. Be sure to leave room for sweets! You will enjoy it if you choose homemade ice cream, we chose excellent sweet potato ice cream, or soft bites of sticky rice.</description>

It is located across the street from the Red Star Stadion, next to a beautiful garden that is far enough from the street and has a pleasant interior. Avalica is spacious enough for larger gatherings and tucked away enough for more intimate occasions. A display case with a good selection of wine labels perfectly accompanies the menu here, not too long, but quite inspiring and based on tradition in a modern edition. Homemade bread with two types of spreads arrives as a couvert, for starters we recommend a hearty soup, and to warm up meze Avalica or light zucchini rolls filled with creamy goat cheese served on tomato cream, with nuts. In the main part, we tried an interesting Ćevap in Stambolov’s style, where ćevapi are served in a bun with warm sataraš. Juicy beef shin with mlinci au gratin and tender marinated pork ribs are also in the offer. The menu includes a daily offer of traditional dishes – dock patience rolls, potato stew and beans. In the Old Serbia section, there are veal head in tripe, and Leskovac mućkalica. Sweetbread and homemade sausages arrive from the grill, as well as beef cheeks, duck breast, and rib eye steak. Vanilla slice, impressively served in a glass with seasonal fruit, and modern Poljubac Avalica with nutella and mascarpone stand out on the list of desserts. A harmonious blend of experience and youth sets this place apart from others.</description>

	<name>KLUB KOŠUTNJAK</name>
	<description>Klub Košutnjak is one of the few places in Belgrade with expertly prepared game meat. Surrounded by greenery, with a beautiful covered garden, away from the traffic and crowd, this restaurant offers an idyllic feeling of being in nature, while the interior is classically decorated. Hunter‘s pate and hearty pheasant soup are our recommendation for starters, and we suggest that you continue on this trail and try spicy hunter‘s sausages, or intriguing dishes with wild boar or deer meat with a characteristic side dish. The menu includes goulash, hearty Karađorđeva steak, good medallions with mushrooms, and the usual national repertoire from the grill, salads are seasonal, and the service is „old school“. The wine list includes labels from Serbia, and desserts include homemade pies (cherry, apple) and hazelnut pie served with a scoop of ice cream and whipped cream.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN PLEZIR</name>
	<description>Restaurant Plezir, tucked away under the canopy in lower Dorćol, is one of the newer restaurants specialized in fine bistro cuisine. Using techniques and knowledge from the world of fine dining, they manage to raise their dishes to a level where enjoying food becomes an art - from dealing with combinations of flavors, textures, considering presentation and ways to raise the guest‘s experience one level higher. An elegant interior, luxurious, and at the same time relaxed, with lots of wooden details, is inviting and it is associated with hedonism. And Plezir offers hedonism in abundance. The menu changes, but some dishes have already acquired the status of classics and deservedly keep their place on it. Be sure to try two interesting tartars. One is with three types of sea fish with black roe, perfectly seasoned and refreshingly sumptuous, and the second tartar is duck breast with goose liver, an original dish that we have not had the opportunity to try in Serbia until now. High-quality pasta and risotto intrigue with their unusual combinations. Among the main dishes they offer horse steak, slow-cooked lamb, and pork cheeks, and in the fish section all the favorites - grouper, octopus or common sole in various combinations. Lovers of good food have something to enjoy. Their now iconic dessert - marzipan and dark chocolate cigar is as Instagrammable as it is delicious.</description>

In the further tasting, the favorites are sweet and spicy pork with peanuts, ginger, and fried onions, great buns - excellent with cod, as well as duck, and some of the dim sum combinations - prawns, pork, chicken, vegetarian.

	<name>RESTORAN KLUB KNJIŽEVNIKA</name>
	<description>A place that has shaped the social life of Belgrade for decades, the famous Francuska 7; the history of art and politics was created by the guests who sat at their tables, and today it is an intriguing, modern restaurant that nourishes tradition, creatively presenting it in new forms and techniques. The interior was renovated, yet it has preserved its patina, while the marvelous garden is a real jewel in the center of the town. If you choose from the classic menu, first try the gibanica, which takes about 25 minutes to prepare. It arrives on a wooden board, the waiter cuts it in front of you, and it melts in your mouth with an intense cheese flavor. The taste of gibanica goes well with Mangalica sausages and homemade ajvar. Great onion soup with pine nuts and raisins is an unusual variation of a classic, while a crispy lamb pie served with quince jelly is an exciting interpretation of tradition. Lamb roast with southern ragout and mint sauce, Mangalica chops with vodouvan paste and fennel cream, Pešter veal, and impressive duck with a crispy roll, are challenges in the meat section. If you are into fish, we recommend Danube perch or Adriatic Sea bass, turbot with vermouth sauce, or risotto with octopus and crispy squid, with light saffron sauce. Each dish arrives imaginatively served with the clear signature of the chef. Among the desserts, the breakthrough is the modern Maccura cake made of coconut, mango and passion fruit, and the obligatory, famous Buda’s Vanilla slice, which brings back old memories.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN JERRY</name>
	<description>Classy, exclusive, and luxurious, Jerry offers a complex and complete fine dining experience in every respect. Well-coordinated staff, selection of top-quality food and ingredients, and an impressive list of spirits and a rich wine list make a visit to this restaurant a unique hedonistic experience. The guests are won over on their first step, when hot chopsticks and a selection of breads arrive at your table, together with goat cheese from their farm in Homolje, olive tapenade and chive spread. The persuasiveness of local flavors is confirmed by the powerful hand-cut steak tartare with pine nuts, served with aromatic butter, perfectly matched by the effective deep-fried goat cheese balls with almonds and served in a spicy sweet-hot sauce. The menu also offers Wagyu and Black Angus steaks, as well as lobster and fresh fish from the Adriatic. Creamy Arborio rice risotto with saffron and shrimp represents part of the menu, which also includes excellent foams with tomato, steak, and pomegranate. In the meat section, we draw your attention to lamb back and baked rib eye with flambéed gnocchi, an interesting combination of tomahawk steak and marinated chanterelles, and veal cheeks with chive puree. Tuna from the Josper oven and salmon with teriyaki sauce are in the fish section. The impressive wine list adequately represents Serbia and exclusive world labels. In the sweet section, two favorites stand out - an attractive gianduja dessert, and a brilliant mille feuille with forest fruits.</description>

	<name>KALEMEGDANSKA TERASA</name>
	<description>This unique restaurant is located in Belgrade’s largest park and beautiful fortress. Kalemegdanska Terasa offers a gourmet pleasure, and it will wake all your senses in a pleasant way. The terrace has a glazed part, and the view stretches out unobstructed before you, while you enjoy the food and the wines from the carefully selected wine list. Because of all this and because of the tradition, which is an obvious motif in the menu and in the decoration, this is one of the most beautiful restaurants in Belgrade. You won’t go wrong if you opt for dishes of traditional French gastronomy, such as the excellent creamy goose liver terrine, served with crusty bread with cranberries and silky fig jam and steak tartare, or for local traditional bites, such as warm crispy pie with tender cheese, served with ajvar and Serbian meze. The stewed veal served with creamy mashed potatoes with truffles is so tender that one can eat it with a spoon. We recommend the irresistibly tender beef cheeks. If you are in the mood for something more substantial, and you plan to dine with a larger group, roasted lamb shoulder with ratatouille in Tamjanika sauce is a great choice. For a lighter dinner, we recommend baked octopus and seabass or grilled perch fillet, with perfectly crispy skin, and for dessert – floating island!</description>

	<name>RESTORAN SALON 5 A</name>
	<description>If you haven’t heard of this restaurant, it shouldn’t surprise you because its unobtrusiveness and discreet charm are obviously a deliberate part of the image of exclusivity it cultivates. Located in a salon–type apartment in a quiet street, near the center of Zemun, its existence is hinted at only by a small inscription on the building’s intercom. Once you step inside and help yourself to cold water and a strip of quince confit, you will have the feeling that you have come to the home of an old friend, with an interior decorated in an eclectic style, combining modern and retro. Friendly staff headed by a chef will make your fine dining experience memorable. The menu changes every few months and is reduced to a maximum, the dishes carry interesting names, yet the choice is such that everyone can find something. In the current, colorful menu, where the dish symbolizes an explosion of colors, flavors and harmonized aromas, the appetizer paradise opens the colorful harmony. It’s a mix of sundried cherry tomatoes and melon balls, with dried, crispy buđola (Capocollo), served in a cream cheese sauce, with the addition of olive oil and essence of ramsons. The following gourmet pleasure is summed up in three words – coin coin coin. It is marinated duck breast, with a side of grilled asparagus, demi–glace sauce with pine nuts, Dijon mustard and, to top it all, a piece of goose pate. Finally, try the italodisco – a chocolate sponge cake dipped in vanilla sauce, with the addition of raspberry and kiwi extract, and a cooked peach served over the sponge cake.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN RADNIČKI</name>
	<description>Although the location is a bit out of the way, this is a must–see destination for all foodies. Everything that Radnički offers leaves an excellent impression and is worth going to. The spacious restaurant also has a garden, which is full, from spring to autumn. The local cuisine is responsible for the modern and effective execution of national dishes, which represent tradition in a creative and interesting way, adding new notes and forms. Pie, stunning in aroma and taste, melted cheese with prosciutto and crispy rolls served with barley and smoked cheese sauce, are warm recommendations for starters. There are all kinds of meat delicacies, kajmak and urnebes, cheeses and fresh seasonal salads, tartar, and homemade spreads. A selection of breads and scones are favorites in every part of the menu. When it comes to grilled meat, there’s ćevapčići and uštipci, pork tenderloin rolls and the unusual Grandma’s pljeskavica on spinach puree. For larger groups, attractively served Ćup and Daska Radnički in dough, Karađorđeva steak is plentiful and juicy, and among the specialties, soft Shepherd’s ribs on kajmak, veal breast on pita bread, Mangalica and pork shank bun, turkey gorgonzola rolls in sesame and good choice of steak stand out. They have an excellent selection of rakija, and a wine list based on Serbian wineries and the region.

	<name>RESTORAN PANTA REI</name>
	<description>Within the sports center „25. maj“ in lower Dorćol, there is Panta Rei, a restaurant that has been a feature of this area for three decades.With a warm welcome, the charming staff will accommodate you in a comfortable corner with a view of the Danube. Perhaps it is most pleasant to come here during a late breakfast and try the excellent panta rei sandwich with prosciutto on brioche bread. If you want to eat lunch, dive into the starters first. The steak parmesan bagel is truly a wonderful experience! Our advice is to order the steak medium rare so that you can really feel all the flavors that this dish has to offer. Then indulge yourself in the wine list and the flavors of the Mediterranean. You certainly won‘t make a mistake, whether you choose the Pazin gnocchi in a fine cream of truffle, turkey and pecorino, or you choose the risotto with saffron, prawns, asparagus and pecorino. If your gourmet mood goes in the direction of something more substantial, go for the pork shank with mlinci and mushrooms. In that combination, you‘re really not sure what will melt in your mouth first. We recommend the slow–roasted boned pork ribs, so soft that you can eat them with a spoon, as well as the spectacular veal under sach in milk. There is also a truly exceptional selection of Mediterranean fish that can be grilled for you.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN SINĐELIĆ</name>
	<description>Considering the long tradition, everyone knows the Sinđelić restaurant. Next to the football field of the Sinđelić soccer club, this is one of those traditional restaurants where you’ll find everything you’re looking for. There are experienced, quick, and skillful waiters, a wide selection of national specialties that comes out of the kitchen, and a harmonious atmosphere that successful restaurants of this capacity exude. Although spacious, Sinđelić is usually full like a beehive, especially on weekends, yet everything flows smoothly. For starters, we suggest the Sinđelić snack, or deep–fried breaded peppers stuffed with cheese, together with quality rakija, and the choice is good – salad like Sjenica bell peppers in sour cream, or grilled chili peppers in oil and garlic, followed by veal soup or beef soup with noodles to warm up your stomach and then you can choose something from the large selection of main dishes. If you prefer lighter food, there is a hearty salad, risotto and pasta. For those with a stronger appetite, or perhaps hungrier, we recommend grilled meat, aged steaks, chicken, turkey and veal specialties, as well as the national pride – sač. The specialties of the house are Sinđelić saber with three types of meat, Čačak ćevapčići and uštipci. Don’t miss the dessert, because you will surely like some of the cakes they will present in front of you.</description>

	<name>CVEĆE ZLA</name>
	<description>It seems that the new location of Cveće zla has become accepted in the minds of their guests as if the move never happened. One of the main reasons for such easy adaptation of their guests is above all the exceptional quality. It is not without reason that it is said that it is easy to get used to good, and even easier to get used to great! There is the well–known vibe of the legacy of the atmosphere of the old Dijagonala, as well as the top service that has always been the trademark of the hospitality ventures of the experienced owner. Classics in their best ever versions are on the plates. If it’s your first time in this restaurant, don’t miss the steak tartare, or the classic tuna tartare. Goose liver is a must for gourmets, and celery with anchovies for vegetarians. Then go for the redesigned burek with mortadella and pistachios or baked bone marrow, and after a few glasses of wine and a chat, you’ll be ready to continue your journey through the local attractive menu. Every pasta on offer is at the level of excellent Italian past, and we especially recommend the ricotta gnocchi. For fish lovers there is grilled salmon and tuna, and the meat lovers will not go wrong with a choice of veal, burger, steak, ćevap, or sausage. With a beautifully designed wine list and a fine selection of wines by the glass, you can easily stroll through the hedonistic experience of Cveće zla.</description>

	<name>PETAR AT TIKA’S</name>
	<description>When you turn towards the Petar At Tika’s restaurant from the very busy Dragoslav Srejovića street, you will first see the beautiful canopy shading the large patio of this very charming restaurant. The friendly, professional, and pleasant staff will escort you to your table where excellent olive oil and various goodies are already served, and you can enjoy them with excellent homemade bread. When choosing from the minimalistic but very deliberate menu, be sure to check with the staff, because they often have some new and exciting dishes that are not listed on the menu. Of the permanent stars of the menu, be sure to start with beef tea, or panko–breaded celery. The extremely thinly sliced celery becomes creamy, and the perfectly crispy panko breading that envelops it provides an exciting contrast in texture. You can‘t go wrong with pork ribs bayadere, Old Scholl veal cutlet, or veal shank in suprême sauce. Each fiber be separated with a spoon, while the sauce has an almost silky texture, and even the classic mashed potatoes as a side dish are prepared in an excellent way. A seriously prepared classic indeed! Consider also Sicilian–style prawns, sea bass tartare with tzatziki cream, and charcoal–grilled octopus leg. Whether it‘s seafood, or selected cuts of meat, this restaurant prepares them without fail. After all, until the next experience, treat yourself with Opium ball or a French Kiss.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN STARI ŽABAR</name>
	<description>The team of experienced restaurateurs who enthusiastically took over the management of the Stari žabar restaurant a few years ago has justified my trust. Everything that the guest enjoys - from the ambiance, services, wine list and menu - has been raised to a higher level, while at the same time Žabar has not lost any of the charm that I love so much. Certainly one of the most beautiful locations for lunch with a view of the river and a traditional destination for enjoyment can boast of an exceptional quality of service. Professional and elegant, yet warm and relaxed at the same time. A large part of the specialties on the menu are now well-known classics whose quality is talked about. There is, first of all, the famous turkey with mlinci, smoked steak and tuna, as well as the traditional Žabar apetizer with warm buns to start, as well as our favorite - octopus with pistachios covered in butter. As for meat, we recommend veal filet and duck leg, excellent duck breast, and lamb and veal cutlets. The position on the water means that Žabar serves excellent river and sea fish. It goes without saying that the friendly waiters will give you a quality recommendation. To round off the enjoyment, there is an extremely wide and well-selected wine list from which you can easily pair wine with food. For the very end, don’t miss Grandma Dara’s refreshing fruit cake.</description>

	<name>STEAK &amp; WINE BAR</name>
	<description>There aren‘t many restaurants where they can literally physically walk you through their wine list. This is what you get in the pleasant atmosphere of the Steak &amp; Wine bar. The well–informed staff will take you on a tour of the impressive selection of wines, and then recommend and agree with you on the best strategy and choice to accompany your meal. From the name of the restaurant, it‘s obvious that steaks are a specialty here, so you can‘t go wrong with the choice of steak. The meat is top quality, the excellent team of chefs knows how to cook it to perfection, and we suggest you ask for medium rare. Before you indulge in the wonderful flavors of steaks, be sure to try the tartare. Steak tartare La France is an exceptional classic with a creamy texture and perfectly balanced spices. Apart from beef, there are two other types of tartare – horse meat tartare and fish tartare with avocado. It‘s great that they have tartare in half portions, and you can combine two flavors on one plate. As a lighter alternative, there are excellent handmade pastas with truffles, veal, or prawns, as well as an excellent steak salad. We recommend you try the aged ćevapi on kajmak that melt in your mouth, and each bite is a perfect combination of an extremely soft structure and the finest taste of beef meat.</description>

It has been in the same location for almost a century, carefully nurturing and respecting the Serbian culinary tradition. The large indoor space has an interestingly designed section with a wine offer, one hall is non-smoking, while the spacious garden is nicely hidden from the busy street. The service is fast and efficient, the offer is based on meat favorites presented in the spirit and style of the new age, and live music adds to the atmosphere.

The offer includes traditional delicacies – pancakes, small cakes, baklava, cooked wheat or chestnut purée with whipped cream... In addition to the famous Moscow schnitte, which has been a symbol of this place for decades, as proof that pastry chefs keep up with the times, there are also modern desserts inspired by the latest world trends, as well as vegan and raw treats.</description>

	<name>KONOBA &amp; WINE BAR TATA MATA</name>
	<description>Located in an old, elegant villa near the Vukov Spomenik, this restaurant will immediately evoke memories of summer, the smells and tastes of the sea, and the sound of waves. The friendly staff will welcome you warmly with a sincere smile, the Dalmatian way. If you want intimacy and a unique experience of being served in a private room of the villa or, on the other hand, premium wine pairings, an excellent selection of labels that the tavern offers, along with a specially created menu, the hosts will gladly indulge you. The carefully designed menu hides pleasure in every bite. Try the juicy, grilled prawns in a sauce of soy, onions and peppers that go well with mashed potatoes with cuttlefish ink, or the seductive cod in bianco, served on homemade crostini. For risotto lovers, the true delicacy is creamy risotto with fresh or smoked seafood and steamed vegetables. Leave room for the main catch - grilled octopus tentacles, soft inside and crispy outside, with garlic dressing and a vegetable side dish, a combination you don’t want to miss. If you want to experience a Dalmatian delicacy that is not a gift from the sea, they have excellent prosciutto, Pag cheese, or pašticada with meat and gnocchi that melt in your mouth in perfect harmony. The desserts in Tata Mata workshop, served at request, will round off your visit.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN DORIAN GRAY</name>
	<description>A pleasant interior and a shady garden under the canopy, along with an elegant setting, good service, and a wine list with a respectable number of labels, are just some of the reasons to choose this restaurant in Dorćol. The menu is broad enough to make an interesting walk around the world. We chose to start our meal with excellent, traditional Parmigiana di Melanzane, and an intriguing baked mushroom julienne cream, served with toasted bread. Among the starters are tartares - steak and tuna, carpaccio and Mangalica delicacies, and bruschetta, sauteed wild mushrooms and squid a la Andalucía. If you prefer pasta or risotto, we recommend tagliatelle with prosciutto and truffles, or risotto with Arborio rice and seafood. The selection of specialties includes steaks in various options, and our attention was drawn to the excellent Skvodorovka, an attractively served Russian dish, impressively spicy combination with pieces of beef fillet, aromatic potatoes, onions, and mushrooms. Tuna with sesame and pepper and teriyaki salmon, sea bass and sea bream, Mediteraneo prawns, and grilled squid are the main offerings in the fish section, and duck with honey and apricots, veal cheeks in polenta and Zerak chicken in the meat section. Finally – Oscar Wilde &amp; Dorian Gray. The first is an imaginatively served Belgian chocolate cake with blueberries and chopped hazelnuts, and the second are creamy pancakes filled with mascarpone cheese, whipped cream, and dried fruit, and topped with orange syrup.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN CANTINA DE FRIDA</name>
	<description>The extremely colorful and vibrant ambiance of this iconic restaurant will instantly convey the spirit of South America to you. The shabby chic design of the restaurant fits perfectly with the pleasant promenade in front of the Beton hall and the view of the river. Whether you are in the mood for a quiet lunch paired with some fine wine or for an exciting dinner with music and a quality cocktail, Cantina de Frida can handle both situations with equal quality. In addition to the selection of cheeses and prosciutto, we recommend tapas. We single out those with excellent crispy squid, which will be phenomenally accompanied by cold draft beer, and excellent kalamata olives in a salsa of dried peppers and cumin. If you need something to warm you up, then Peruvian soup with prawns and glass noodles is the right choice. Of course, we cannot venture into the gastronomy of South America without recognizing Asad, a traditional technique of grill preparation that recognizes food as a social event and the most important factor of enjoyment. Carefully selected pieces of meat, from T–bone steak, rib-eye steak, and even octopus to slightly smoked chorizo sausages with a Spanish mixture of spices, with a special grilling method become mouth–watering bites. From a rich selection of wine labels from all over the world, you can choose a wine according to your affinity. But if you are in the mood for something quick and tasty, there is a wide range of Tex–Mex cuisine such as tacos, burritos, fajitas and of course, burgers.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN DURMITOR</name>
	<description>Durmitor is the place to go for spit-roasted meat. Delicious, and juicy veal, lamb, and goat meat has been prepared here from its opening until today. Make a reservation, both for a table, and the roast. Conveniently hidden in the central part of New Belgrade, with the interior part on the upper floor, this restaurant has been extended to a large and very pleasant garden. In the morning you will have a choice of substantial breakfast options, and in lunch time, do not skip the excellent veal soup. In any case, our recommendation in the introductory part goes to the local steak tartare, serious, convincing, and nicely spicy, and next to it, there are selections of meat delicacies and cheeses, as well as deep-fried oyster mushrooms and bell peppers with cheese. Apart from the famous, already mentioned roast, the main menu offers meat in all forms. Tuna steak, salmon, trout, and squid represent the fish segment of the offer. Everything is accompanied by a serious wine list, which is dominated by Serbian and regional wines. The local steak in olive oil is famous, the attractively served Karađorđe steak is a frequent choice, and we also recommend the marinated neck and lamb pljeskavica. They prepare everything in order on the grill, while the selection of steaks is separate in the beef section. In the sweet section, depending on the season, they offer au gratin raspberries or tangerines, and tres leches, poppy seed cake and homemade vanilla slice are also recommended.</description>

	<name>JAM - JUST A MAESTRO</name>
	<description>Exciting and playful, inspiring, and creative, Just A Maestro is one of those places that will charm you at first glance and first bite. It is a synthesis of all the elements of modern hospitality: effectively designed interior, table setting and service, and well-coordinated and trained staff. And, naturally, a signature menu and a carefully designed wine list. The tartar is expertly prepared, perfectly tasty, and served with homemade brioche, capers, cucumbers and pickled onions, and an aioli sauce to manage the spiciness. Duck liver pâté or duck rillettes are also tempting appetizers, and don’t skip the sumptuous bouillabaisse with mussels, sea bass and prawns. In the pasta and risotto section, land and sea are skilfully combined. Tortellini with ricotta and pesto, sprinkled with almonds, and linguini with large prawns in pistachio sauce. Black risotto from Adriatic cuttlefish and ribeye stand out as distinctive specialties of the house, the JAM burger is attractively served under a cloche, and homemade sausages and Mangalica cutlet are a fine tribute to the local cuisine. Ask which Adriatic fish is on offer, and don’t miss the perfectly tender duck with celery puree and barley risotto. An intriguing list of cocktails and a wine list that boldly cruises through Serbia and various meridians harmoniously pairing tastes. The rhapsody continues with chocolate tart sprinkled with sea salt and blueberry cake with lemon balm and lemon. Imaginative and magical, no less.</description>

	<name>IVA NEW BALKAN CUISINE</name>
	<description>Vanja Puškar, the main and responsible person standing behind the entire New Balkan Cuisine scene, says that Iva is a bistro that got out of control - in the most positive sense! The unpretentious interior is complemented by the pleasant and friendly staff. The waiters are warm and caring professionals, you will feel you are having lunch with dear friends. The cuisine is based on local Balkan specialties, all of which are skillfully twisted or turned upside down in such a way that they become completely new specialties. While you browse the menu, whet your appetite with one of the specialty cocktails. Crispy buckwheat rolls filled with cheese and drizzled with honey and sprinkled with walnuts are an unreal game of paradoxes- simultaneously hot and cold, crunchy and creamy, sweet and bitter-salty. Don’t miss the beef buns or the magical crispy fried beef legs. Continue intriguing your palate with the perfect pork bayadere, or homemade gnocchi with calf’s brain in an exquisite oxtail sauce. Spectacular vegetarian dishes in the Balkans? O yes! You will remember celery root confit in celery and truffle cream for a long time! A delicate and creamy dish, where the bold aroma of celery blends very finely with the aroma of butter and truffles. Round off the experience with cauliflower cake or homemade gnocchi prepared with plum stone flour. These gnocchi are playing with the deconstruction of grandma’s favorite delicacy - plum dumplings.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN AMBAR</name>
	<description>Located in the heart of Belgrade’s Beton Hall, Ambar is one of the restaurants that have a modern approach to Balkan cuisine. In their case, modernity implies a certain freedom in the interpretation of dishes and evokes a sense of cuisine fusion. This is certainly the most logical approach to the Balkans as a gastronomic destination. Most of the menu is served in a smaller portion format, which we enjoy because it gives us the opportunity to try more different specialties. The offer includes interesting cauliflower popcorn with a secret dressing, a baked flatbread filled with hummus and cheese, bell peppers with crumbled cheese and kalamata olive jam. Don’t skip gibanica served on yoghurt with a gentle touch of mint. It is perfect! Followed by a few classics from the specialty section, such as their popular monastery chicken deep fried in almonds and walnuts, Mediterranean-inspired lamb meatballs, but also classic ćevapi served with finely chopped onions and spicy paprika. Spicy pljeskavica enriched with roasted peppers and then coated with demi-glace, classic Karađorđe schnitzel or Ambar ćevapi sprinkled with mature cow’s cheese served on vegetables are among the main dishes and will be a challenge even for gourmet guests. For the end, we recommend the Vanilla slice or floating island. You will enjoy it.</description>

	<name>MALA KOLUBARA NA RECI</name>
	<description>Mala Kolubara, a name we know well from its original downtown location, has moved to the river, the Sava embankment, a location that is becoming increasingly popular in terms of gastronomy. A rustic ambience, with pictures of old Belgrade, and a spacious terrace on the river adds a relaxing note to the homely atmosphere. A glass of rakija will whet your appetite just like reading the menu, where the national cuisine is based on meat specialties. As a warm appetizer, we recommend crispy rolls in an intense combination of goat cheese, prosciutto and peppers. Do not skip burek pljeskavica served on burek dough, one of the specialties here. A juicy pljeskavica with kajmak arrives on an interesting base decorated with urda urnebes. If you’re looking for something lighter, we suggest Zlatibor chicken baked with chopped peppers and prosciutto in a kajmak sauce. Make sure you ask what’s on the menu from roasts and daily cooked dishes. Pork neck and ribs, shredded pork loin, ćevapi and excellent sausages, Šumadija opanak and rumpsteak in olive oil with cheese kept in animal hide (mešina) continue the local gourmet series, which is complemented by the šopska or moravska salad in the summer, and sauerkraut, pickles, and homemade ajvar in the winter. Sweeten yourself with baklava or fruit crepes, and we recommend that you save room for a large slice of excellent Vasa’s cake, which is juicy, refreshing, and creamy, just the way it should be.</description>

	<description>The extremely professional and capable staff of Madera will make you feel like you’re visiting close friends. Be sure to listen to the advice on which rakija will whet your appetite and be sure to ask about the wine selection, because the menu is impressive. We recommend the homemade chicken pâté with black truffles and fried dough. An excellent creamy pâté with a gentle aroma of truffles, combined with fried dough that is crunchy and soft at the same time. Of the other appetizers, of which there are plenty, we suggest a variety of home-style snacks, then pearls of European cuisine such as goose liver terrine, steak tartare, or smoked salmon terrine. They also offer creamy soups and homemade soups with dumplings or homemade noodles, just like at grandma’s. They are followed by the classics from the grill and the classics of the restaurant itself. From excellent Karađorđe schnitzel, to grilled pork medallions with mushroom sauce and, of course, the star of Madera’s menu, the famous lamb kapama with sour milk that is served on Sundays. You should not skip some of the specialties such as duck breast on green pea puree, duck cracklings, or sous vide lamb shank, which practically melts in every bite, followed by river and sea fish, as well as seafood, among which we highlight the excellent octopus served with beetroot puree. The octopus, crispy and creamy at the same time, together with the contrast of the pink puree presents an exquisite artistic delight.</description>

The Bruchetteria section opens the menu, and there are classic bruschetta with tomatoes and mozzarella, powerful Friuli meat rhapsodies, and juicy bruschetta with wild mushrooms and truffle oil. There are melanzane and grilled Miroč cheese, followed by the Salumeria selection of delicacies, and Antipasto Freddo with several splendid salads and two intriguing tartares – tuna with flavored orange and pistachios, and steak with truffle oil, Piran salt and Ligurian olive tapenade. Wood–fired pizza oven is in the central part of the restaurant - you must try one of the combinations on the dough of perfect thickness. The offer goes from focaccia with prosciutto to Bresaola and Dassi with Italian prosciutto and Mortadella with pistachio cream. The meat &amp; fish section is divided into two segments – Italy, the classics in our way, which represents all famous Italian specialties, and Carni locali, where there are attractive pork bbq ribs, artisanal sausage, and Verde steak. The meat from the Mibrasa charcoal oven is the finest steaks such as Japanese Wagyu, black Angus, and st. George’s lamb. The menu also includes pastas, and all of this is harmoniously accompanied by a wine list dominated by labels from Italy and Serbia. Harmonious Tricolore combination of mousses, great alpine apple cake, lemon tart, or interesting tiramisu with hazelnut sweetly and convincingly confirm that Piazza is an excellent choice for Italian cuisine.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN TABOR</name>
	<description>This year Tabor is celebrating 40 years of serving lovers of national cuisine. When you are near Cvetkova pijaca and a rather chaotic intersection, you have arrived to Tabor and, as soon as you enter the restaurant, you will forget about the unattractive surroundings. You will immediately be disarmed by the charm of the tucked–away space, as well as by the friendly staff. From excellent soups that will warm your stomach, and a good selection of rakijas that will warm your soul, get ready for a hearty, homely meal. Warning – their bread is fantastic, warm, and soft with a crispy crust. Leave room for what’s yet to come. Bacon–wrapped prunes, steak tartare, or parmesan– crusted chicken liver pâté are excellent preludes. If you are in the mood for grilled classics – Tabor pljeskavica with Pirot cheese, fresh chili pepper, onion, and kajmak is highly recommended, and grilled ćevapi with urnebes, as well as gourmet uštipci, are not far behind. If you’re in the mood to cook, that’s possible too! You can order a steak on a hot volcanic stone and finish it yourself at the table. Pork shin with mlinci, as well as boned pork with crispy skin, are highly recommended. However, you will certainly remember the pork cheeks for the longest time – slow cooked, and tender, in their own sauce, and served with mashed potatoes and roasted carrots, they will not leave you indifferent. In the enviable list of desserts, you will surely find a taste that will sweeten the ending.</description>

	<name>KONOBA KOD GOCE I RENATA</name>
	<description>On the very bank of the river, next to the Pančevo bridge, the konoba Kod Goce i Renata is a good destination to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city, as it is equally close to Belgrade and Pančevo. The large, rustically decorated garden and the beautiful interior are a pleasant environment and being on the riverbank and overlooking the city across the river give everything an extra relaxing touch. A rich and mildly spicy fish broth is a must for starters, and fish pâté and crispy zucchini fried in panko breadcrumbs that arrive on a large wooden board stand out as appetizers. Furthermore, you need to decide whether you prefer fish, river or sea, or meat specialties. The fish is prepared in the disc or on grill - ask what is fresh from the catch. We tried delicious sterlet, which is not always available, there are also perch, carp, and catfish. Along with river fish, sea bream and sea bass represent the sea beautifully. Grilled squid is the dish they are famous for, which was confirmed when we tried it. Spaghetti with seafood worthily represents the pasta section, which also includes spaghetti with shrimps and pasta with prawns and parmesan cheese. In that part of the menu, there are black, red, and white risottos, and the vegan menu is separated. If you’re into meat, everything is here, from grilled specialties to Karađorđe steak and beef steak. Tres leches, baklava, and tulumba are suggestions for the end, to nicely round off the whole atmosphere by the Danube River.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN ČAJKOVSKI</name>
	<description>The former Kafana Moskva, and today the Čajkovski restaurant, is one of those places that, with its many years of presence on the hospitality scene, left a historical mark on Belgrade and on all the people who have passed through them. A place full of stories, visited by historical figures and everyday people in search of a simple chat, as well as the famous Moskva šnit cake, which is certainly one of the most famous Belgrade hotel rituals of many generations. Under the leadership of its new Chef, the Čajkovski restaurant has recognized in the right way some of the important catering trends, above all the importance of the origin of ingredients and promoting their local geographical features. The menu offers goat‘s milk cheese from the village of Gunjaci, or đubek, a cheese made from steamed dough, originating from the dairy school in Pirot. We welcome this because relying on the quality of the food, which cannot exist without a relationship to the origin, together with culinary knowledge and techniques, is the only real solution for quality food. The menu also includes international specialties from Italy, Greece and France framed in an original, mature, and meaningful concept of the capital‘s hotel restaurant. With the sounds of a concert piano, you will enjoy quality service and good food at one of the most central locations in Belgrade.</description>

Friendly staff will welcome you here, where you can really hide from the rest of the world and indulge in the top flavors of the Far East. As you browse the colorful menu, be sure to order the Crispy Edamame first, a special twist on the famous Japanese classic. Each edamame is individually fried in tempura and seasoned with truffle oil. If you decide to have a lighter meal, there is an excellent meal of Wakame King Crab salad or Quinoa Edamame salad. The kitchen offers four excellent tartares –tuna, salmon, steak, and sea bass, and you can modify the spiciness in agreement with the waiter. Once you‘ve chosen your flavor, they‘ll serve it on buckwheat bread, or nori seaweed in tempura we can recommend. In addition to excellent gyoza and spring rolls, there is a wide selection of noodles, wok combinations, and various tempura specialties. Whether you are in the mood for fish or meat, the choice will not leave you indifferent. Tuna in several ways, we single out tuna in pepper, or the European– Asian mix: Tuna Wellington.

	<name>RESTORAN &amp; KOKTEL BAR ANGRY MONK</name>
	<description>The inscription on the entrance of the Angry Monk reads Cocktail lab and food temple. Start your gastronomic experience with a specially designed cocktail, and our recommendation is Is it Safe, which arrives on the table on fire, a visually entertaining experience. While the emphasis is definitely on outstanding sushi, don‘t stop there. Baked cauliflower florets, which are set against crispy puffed rice in a bowl, topped with basil and mint crisps and garnished with flowers, are truly a spectacle for all the senses. Add tuna tataki on beetroot tartare to that, and your gastronomic journey will be on the right track. The ramen looks like it came straight from a Japanese restaurant. A truly umami experience. If you‘re in the mood for something more substantial, try the pork ribs in Asian BBQ sauce, served on a perfect savory sweet potato croquette. This dish is served with a small meat cleaver, which you can easily use to cut the leaves of meat that practically melts in your mouth. If by some chance there is room left, be sure to round off the meal with an oat pie – Crack Pie, a symphony of sweet and salty, crunchy and creamy and buttery. The entire experience is rounded off by an impeccably professional and friendly staff who will be happy to advise and guide you through this Asian journey.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN &amp; KOKTEL BAR JOSEPHINE</name>
	<description>The refinement and elegance of the decadent art deco style, which takes us back to the 1920’s and the time of dazzling interiors, is perfectly connected with the spirit of modernity in the restaurant that bears the name of the most celebrated French performer of American origin. Located on the busy Slavija Square, yet far away from the hustle and bustle, Josephine certainly boasts a lot – from special attention to every detail, one of the most beautiful green patios–oases in the city, and a superb selection of wines and spirits of all kinds. Understandingly, their gastronomic offer is equally impressive. From the first taste of a warm-up bites, such as finely chopped roast pork with avocado, radishes, and fresh herbs in a homemade tortilla whose gourmet aromas blend into a perfect unity or, on the other hand, crispy spring rolls with a rich filling of Mangalitsa prosciutto, cheddar cheese and asparagus, it is clear that pleasure is abundant here. They also serve their trademark dishes, such as the lightly stewed milky veal on polenta - the softness and the juiciness evoke the deepest enjoyment, or the excellent pork tam tam – a marbled piece of boned meat, bayadere style, with homemade puree, grilled spring onions and aromatic raspberry jam with a hint of truffle. For a sense of gastronomic art, you should try the seductive pistachio cake on white chocolate with raspberry gel and ice cream or, perhaps, the homemade apple pie with vanilla sauce. Play the game of hedonism, just like Josephine once did.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN SPLAV SUVENIR</name>
	<description>There are a few restaurants in Serbia that first successfully mastered a certain aspect of catering, and then earned a master’s degree and a doctorate in that field. Suvenir is one of them, with a unique atmosphere that they carefully nurture. Whenever you find yourself near the Sava River, you will enjoy the idyllic atmosphere at Suvenir. The morning winter sun, the fire in the fireplace in the evening and the perfect lighting or enjoying the patio in summer will make you happy just for being there. The extremely professional staff is friendly and enthusiastic, they have certainly mastered the topic of service. The menu is expertly designed and precisely meets the needs of their clientele, while a lot of effort has been put into the dining experience itself. Carts with hot, huge homemade bread that has just come out from under the sač, cut in front of guests, and waiters cleaning fish on carts or removing bones from delicious roast pork, contribute to the pleasant atmosphere and the feeling that every guest is important. An excellent and extensive wine list, a sufficient number of wines by the glass, and a good recommendation by the waiter will make the wine experience equally high quality. The offer includes specialties such as stuffed Suvenir fillet, ribs with shiitake mushrooms, a large selection of Adriatic fish and seafood, as well as a serious section with river fish. You won’t go wrong no matter what you choose from the main menu or desserts.</description>

	<description>Comunale is one of the trademarks of Beton Hall, a popular Belgrade destination for both gourmets and party lovers. With minimalism in the interior, with an accent on Mediterranean–Italian cuisine, and a meticulous selection of drinks, this restaurant offers a very interesting experience. To whet your appetite, you can start with a rich selection of premium Italian delicacies and cheeses, bruschetta with grilled peppers and goat cheese, or with truffles and porcini mushrooms. If you prefer a lighter option, we recommend one of the great, exotic salads, such as the one with octopus or vegetables, red quinoa, mint, and lamb‘s lettuce. There is also no mistake with homemade pastas and gnocchi, whether you opt for meat – pljukanci with steak, fish – pasta with prawns, zucchini and saffron, or vegetarian – tagliolini alla norma with cherry tomatoes, eggplant, mozzarella and rocket. Followed by focaccia, pizza, then meat or fish from the Josper oven with an unforgettable, smoky taste and smell. Grilled wild salmon or chicken fillet with cauliflower puree are a must try.

	<name>NACIONALNI RESTORAN BELA REKA</name>
	<description>The keeper of traditional flavors with a touch of modernity, in a spacious and elegant environment in green and earthy tones, Bela reka guides every guest through the rich flavors offered by our country. As with any true host, this restaurant uses exclusively home- grown food, either from their farm in the Homolje mountains valley, famous for its Gramina cheeses, or from other reliable farmers. At the beginning, play with the senses with dishes saved from oblivion, such as cicvara, where the notes of cornmeal, cow’s cheese, kajmak and butter flow into the harmony of flavors. A good combination is the calorie bomb, finely grilled pieces of steak in a crispy fried roll, topped with a gentle pumpkin seed sauce, to balance and raise the taste by an octave. When your expectations are at their peak, try an authentic symphony of softness, crispiness, sweet and salty sensations in masterfully prepared duck drumstick with homemade maple syrup. With a light pea and potato puree, every bite will bring you back to your childhood, to your grandmother’s kitchen. And just like at grandma’s, soft home-made vanilice or orasnice are waiting for you at the end. A careful selection of local wines and beers will contribute to an unforgettable taste. If you want to take home a piece of this magic, you can also do so if you visit the local delicatessen shop in the restaurant.</description>

	<description>Allow the extremely friendly staff to accommodate you, rouse your appetite with an aperitif or a glass of sparkling wine and go through the menu carefully. Whether you warm up with the excellent consommé served before you, or whether you opt for colder yet equally good dishes, such as steak tartare, sea bass ceviche or raw tuna served on crispy rice with vegetables marinated in Szechuan sauce, you will have a very high–quality gourmet experience. It will be hard to choose between a carefully selected piece of meat such as Iberico Pluma de Ballota, dry aged T–bone, rib eye, tuna steak or for a carefully prepared specialty such as perfectly roasted Hoisin duck combined with a very potent Hoisin sauce and served on sweet and savory carrot and anise puree or, perhaps, slow–roasted veal with wild mushrooms that will melt in your mouth with every bite. Add to all this the excellent, handmade egg pasta served in various varieties and the excellent kumquat risotto that brings together several flavors and textures in a very daring way. Get ready for sweet torment. Speaking of sweets, you must not leave this restaurant without trying the wild raspberry truffle. It is a sumptuous, buttery, and creamy chocolate cake, enriched with truffles and topped with a sauce that is basically the essence of raspberries.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN PINOT</name>
	<description>One comes to Pinot for the wine and stays for the food! The wine list has been selected with great care and offers a truly impressive selection of classics, rarities and hidden pearls from the region and the world. There is also a wide selection of wines by the glass, so don’t hesitate to try a few types before choosing a bottle to accompany your meal. The extremely friendly and very well–trained staff will be happy to discuss your wine preferences with you before helping you choose the right wine, but also the right dish that will go best with that wine. It is recommended to start with the classics. Foie gras and pineapple and chili chutney on brioche bread is a vivacious bite that plays with spicy and sweet, creamy, and crunchy, hot and cold. Steak tartare or prawn tartare are also good choices. Bao buns are a slightly more modern alternative, whether they are made with duck confit or pork, wittily named Vlach Magic, you won’t go wrong. The menu is not extensive, but it is fun and substantial. There is a selection of steaks in which the parmesan and pistachio–crusted steak stands out, as well as the aged rib eye. We recommend the extremely soft beef cheeks in red wine sauce, served on a creamy chestnut puree, with discreet notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. Duck drumsticks and tequila–flambéed prawns are also an excellent choice.</description>

	<name>TORO LATIN GASTROBAR</name>
	<description>Toro Latin Gastrobar offers a fusion of Latin cuisine and Asian gastronomic trends. In addition to a selection of very carefully served fusions of the flavors of these two cuisines, they also make excellent cocktails, as well as a well selected wine list, mostly based on the region. This restaurant is also known for its very generous and delicious breakfast they serve on weekends, when you can try almost everything from the rich breakfast offer at a very reasonable price. Our recommendation is not to miss the steak tartare prepared with a special Latin twist. Namely, in addition to crushed Brazil nuts, marinated jalapeño peppers are added to the steak, which bring a special piquancy and freshness to this classic. An additional plus is that they combine it as a special show at your table. The interesting series continues with the specialties they named Suviche (a combination of Latin seviche and Asian sushi). Among the hot appetizers, Firework prawns in crispy tempura, which are then tucked in spicy mayonnaise, stand out. Whether you’re into tacos or grilled meat, Toro won’t let you down. For lovers of quality meat, Toro Steak, black angus tomahawk or dry aged rib eye are excellent choices. Don’t skip the excellent roasted peppers that are additionally enriched with cashew aioli and sweetened with passion fruit glaze! They accompany the perfectly prepared pieces of meat from the grill in a fantastic way. If you’re after dessert, their version of Tres Leches is excellent, while La Bomba is an unforgettable experience!</description>

	<name>TISA NEW BALKAN CUISINE</name>
	<description>The New Balkan Cuisine concept, with the Tisa restaurant as its newest member, was developed by Vanja Puškar, a virtuoso of the Serbian gourmet scene, and has already established itself as a place of recognizable cuisine that we always happily return to. As with all success stories, the principles behind the concept are extremely simple – the redesign of Balkan cuisine, the use of ingredients specific to the climate and cooperation with local producers. With creative ideas and combinations, a new form of classics on a plate was created, and enjoyment is guaranteed. Important segments of this story are the ambience, which is simple, reduced, with a touch of minimalism but not cold, as well as the staff, who are extremely pleasant and friendly with their guests. Just reading the menu will delight you with the excellent combination of ingredients and you will have a serious dilemma about what to order, because you will want to try everything. It doesn’t matter which of the great appetizers you choose, because enjoyment is guaranteed no matter what you decide on – crispy buckwheat flour rolls with young cheese, honey and caramelized walnuts, juicy pork leg croquettes with cream of fresh lemon and chives, Ljutenica, mustard greens and horseradish or maybe a mini–bun with lamb, tomato salsa or olives and marinated cucumber. The impression is the same with the main specialties on the menu – pork on the side, juicy lamb, veal ribs with deep fried urnebes ball, and Istrian pasta with Mangalitsa lard and truffles. The end is sweetest with a chocolate cake with black truffle or a baked tart with prunes.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN RODIZIO</name>
	<description>The spirit of Latin American haciendas, with aged, first–class cuts of meat and the exceptional way of their preparation, serving and presentation. All this was transferred to the business district of New Belgrade and makes the offer of the Rodizio restaurant. A luxurious and modernly equipped ambience, with ranch motifs, and wine and meat showcase, as well as friendly and well–coordinated staff tell you that you are in for a treat right from the first impression. Make yourself comfortable and order some good red wine. It is recommended not to skip the one from South Africa, so the tasting can begin. You choose whether you will try meat aged for 25, 50 or 90 days, and whether you will choose t–bone steak, tomahawk, porterhouse, or classic steak. For a dose of luxury, season the meat with gold flakes, and for a real rhapsody of taste, there is a jewel in the offer – picanha, the juiciest piece of marbled beef. If you have a voracious appetite and are ready for a meat earthquake, the specialty of the house – Rodizio grill or a selection of 11 different types of meat – is a must. Pleasure is not only for the palate but also for the eye, because Rodizio grill is served in a special way. Well-trained waiters, cortadores, use a large sword to chop pieces of meat in front of you and serve them in a well–coordinated rhythm from several small portions, ensuring that each bite preserves the perfect juiciness and temperature. If all this was not sweet enough, at the end there is a premium cake or a portion of churros.</description>

	<name>OSTERIA MOZZARELLA</name>
	<description>The cute restaurant Osteria Mozzarela takes you on a gastronomic adventure with the most beautiful flavors of Italy begins with an unusual gourmet route along all the Italian regions. If we start from Piedmont, try the Italian French toast, or veal medallions, and have the cake with three types of milk for dessert. Lombardy will tempt you with the aromas of green risotto with turkey, or gnocchi with zucchini and salmon in the Italian way, and the sweet magic is in the authentic cheesecake. The sounds of the waves washing the coast are in the flavors of Liguria with the typical aromas of calamari in tomato sauce, or Livorno octopus. Magical Tuscany will bare its soul to us with pork neck on beans, veal tagliata or homemade profiteroles with chocolate. Of course, all roads lead to Rome and the Lazio region with classics, such as delicious soft-crispy turkey saltimbocca, turkey salad or prawns in white sauce. It wouldn’t be Italy without Campania and its phenomenal selection of pizzas. Finally, you can sail to the romantic south, to Sicily and treat yourself to a traditional breakfast, mortadella-pistachio pizza, or Sicilian cannoli. And this is just a peek at discovering the regions of Italy and their characteristic flavors.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN NOVAK 1</name>
	<description>In two Belgrade locations, Novi Beograd and Dorćol, Novak restaurants offer a delightful gastronomic experience that conveniently combines international cuisine with some of the classics. The dedication to one of the world’s greatest athletes is in details and features, while current sports events are often displayed on the screens. The menu opens with two interesting vegan creations, a rich panko breaded vegetarian steak and vegetable noodles with tofu cheese. If you want to stay on home turf, check what’s on Table D’hôte and try the excellent grilled cheese rskavac, served with tobacco cracklings and ajvar. There are also uštipci gratinated with roasted peppers and kajmak, traditional pljeskavica with onion and sausage with cheese. Furthermore - burritos with chicken or well- prepared grilled turkey with fine hazelnut sauce, tortilla rolls with spinach and spicy risotto, and we recommend that you try baked pasta. Choose the main ingredient - chicken, turkey or salmon, and enjoy. The portion is generous and tasty, and it is the right choice for a larger group. The main part of the menu includes rump steak with caramelized onions and feta cheese, pepper steak, and steak with enchilada. In the fish section, we recommend tuna and salmon steak, grilled squid, and sea bass with sauteed vegetables. Along with a large selection of pancakes, the absolute favorite among the delicacies is the unusual cake with an unusual name, Vatrena ljubav, with a perfect balance of textures, cream, and fruit.</description>

	<name>HOMA</name>
	<description>If you are visiting Homa for the first time, enjoy the inconspicuous interior, minimalism in the style and decoration of the space, and the isolated and unexpected location of the restaurant, in Dorćol. However, expect hedonism, creativity of the author’s kitchen and great flavors that change seasonally that go to the maximum. With soft music playing in the background, while tasting one of the top wines from the carefully selected national or international sommelier’s offer, start the rhapsody of flavors with a creatively served beef tail consommé with a vurda dumpling, or a seductive cuttlefish ragout with homemade pasta, cuttlefish ink and saffron. Even the lighter flavors carry notes of the unexpected, like the imaginative watermelon, goat cheese and pistachio salad. Or endive salad with caramelized seeds, hummus with red currants, and a tahini and soy dressing. And just when you think it can’t get any better, you will be impressed once again, with a piece of rump steak aged for 60 days with a side dish of grilled Jerusalem artichoke, porcini mushrooms and hollandaise sauce. Finally, the sweets are the culmination of pleasure like baklava with pine nuts with the addition of candied orange sabayon and pear sorbet. The ingredients are ingenious, the prudent combination is perfect, and the taste sensation is lasting. Homa is the place for explorers.</description>

All those thoughts fall into oblivion after the first bite, as you indulge in pure pleasure. Whether you started with tuna crudo on spicy avocado puree, where the textures of avocado and tuna complement each other in a fun way, or with classic hummus additionally enriched with shiitake mushrooms and served with homemade pita bread, or you opt for a carefully selected selection of cheeses and dried meat products from Kosmaj, you can’t go wrong.

	<name>KOLO BISTROT BALKANIQUE</name>
	<description>Located in the Galerija shopping mall, Kolo captivates with its unusual design that harmoniously combines traditional symbols with modern details. They also have a garden along the Sava River Promenade, and a view of the open kitchen. The attractive bistrot Balkanique concept is consistently implemented in the interior design, on the menu and on the plates. Although the location calls for it, Kolo is not only a place to take a break from shopping, but it is also inspiring enough to visit this particular restaurant. You can read on the paper coasters how the kolo dance was created, and what are the key details of Serbian folklore. The famous Pirot đubek is served in a pan, sprinkled with cracklings, and roasted hazelnuts, and we suggest as an ideal pair for this specialty veal rolls with roasted peppers, arugula, and cheese mousse, topped with spicy sauce. The main part brings the expected intense flavors, so we tried beef shin au gratin with soft dough crust with carrots, potatoes and kajmak, a dish for which you won’t need a knife. The ubiquitous truffles appear here in the company of a pljeskavica on pita bread, with pickled onions and pickles that give a good balance to this unusual combination of flavors. They also offer Homolje lamb, game sausages, pork ribs and Mangalica neck. In the sweet part, Kolo skillfully expands and successfully plays beyond the limits, so both Paris brest and Pavlova served in a glass with lots of fruit left an excellent impression.</description>

	<name>RESTORAN THE TWENTY TWO</name>
	<description>This elegant restaurant is located on the roof of the Metropol Hotel and offers a breathtaking panoramic view of the city. Refined interior design, modern design, as well as professional staff who welcome you with a smile are the first impressions when you walk in. The carefully designed menu does not offer many dishes, but each one is a real small feat. In the section of cold appetizers, smoked burrata in puff pastry with Napoli sauce and Granny Smith duck confit – a seductive combination of liver, tangy apple and mushroom carpaccio stand out. Warm bites start with a somewhat surprising selection of homemade burek, but in a modern version – divided into segments with kajmak, Greek yogurt and cheese, followed by exotic shrimp and kumquat risotto, served with a side of celery, butter, zucchini and pumpkin oil. In the soup section, there is beef tea and Tuscan tomato soup. The main dish offer is the crown - such as Iberian pork steak with dark beer and a side of pie with aged cheese and potato cream or duck meat served in milk. The fish menu offers the flavors of juicy salmon in a crust or red mullet fillet with sweet corn puree. We also recommend the steaks. The coconut foam or Belgian garden with three types of chocolate and different textures are certainly a notable finale.</description>

	<name>CAMPANIA PIZZA GOURMET</name>
	<description>The offer of the Campania Pizza Gourmet restaurant brings a touch of the Apennines and the rich gourmet flavors of Italy. As a contrast to the strict and cold business-residential complex in which it is located, the ambiance of the restaurant exudes warmth and the welcome you will experience from the first bites, and the flavors are more than great. Start your pleasure with baked crostini in several options - with tomatoes, stewed vegetables or nduja, a spicy sausage from Calabria. There are also classics like bocconcini with ricotta and zucchini, Sicilian rice balls with vegetables and mozzarella, arancini or caponata, stewed eggplant in extra virgin olive oil sauce. All the pasta comes from Gragnano, Campania region and it is bronze-die pasta. It’s up to you to choose whether you want gnocchi with truffles, tagliatelle with several types of mushrooms, spaghetti alla putanesca or one of the pasta varieties. Save room for one of the main courses where you can expect refreshing chicken in lemon sauce, oven- braised beef meatballs with tomato sauce, salmon with vegetables baked in a wood-fired oven, or perhaps, 35–40-day aged beef steak. An excellent selection of Neapolitan pizzas prepared in a wood-fired oven is amazing. You won’t be disappointed by the desserts either, so choose from the original tiramisu, caprese cake, panna cotta or lemon ice cream sorbet. With Aperol, grappa, or good wine, you will have a full gastronomic experience of Italy.</description>

The authentic spirit and flavor of the Adriatic was brought and refined directly from Herceg Novi by dedicated owners who have been improving the quality of the offer for over two decades.
