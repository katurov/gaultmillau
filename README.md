# Gault & Millau

I make a map from [Gault &amp; Millau](https://www.gaultmillau.org/?lang=en) in [Serbian cities](https://rs.gaultmillau.com/en/search?keyword=Beograd&lat=45.259199284194004&lng=19.852908236420348&location=all#search)

## How to read

Gault Millau rates restaurants on a scale of 1 to 20, with 20 being the highest. Restaurants given **below 10 points are rarely listed**. The points are awarded based on the quality of the food, with comments about service, price or the atmosphere of the restaurant given separately. Based on this rating, high-ranking restaurants may **display one to four toques**. Gault Millau does not accept payment for listing restaurants.

## WHY

It isn't easy to understand which restaurant is near to you, your hotel, your route without map representation. So I made different formats of the map, depending of the application you use for navigation. Here are main files and formats. If you know more about them, lets discuss it in "Issues".
